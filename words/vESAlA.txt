Because Nābhāga, the son of Diṣṭa had married a woman from Vaiśya caste, he also became Vaiśya. The writings of Vatsa, the son of Bhalandana of this family, are included in the Ṛgveda. The differentiation of castes was not so strict in those days as today. It is not known in what country Diṣṭa and his people Anagas lived. The Kings Karandhama, his son Avikṣit and his son Marutta of this dynasty were great and valiant. Marutta had performed both horse sacrifice (aśvamedha) and imperial consecration (Rājasūya). To Tṛṇabindu, who was in the tenth generation from Marutta, a son was born named Viśāla. This Viśāla founded a city and lived there. That city is called Vaiśālā. Many of the scholars are of opinion that this city Vaiśālā is the same as Ujjayinī. It is stated in Mahābhārata that Somadatta of the seventh generation from Viśāla had performed ten aśvamedhas (horse-sacrifices)."
