All the sand particles on the shore of the sea of Amṛta are jewels. Beyond the trees of jewels standing on the seacoast, there is an iron-wall with four towers. Those who come here to see Devī (goddess) should get down from their vehicles here. Beyond this wall of iron, there are seven walls of bronze, copper, lead, brass, a mixture of five metals, silver and gold. They are called Saptaśālas. Between the walls there are several parks such as Kalpavāṭikā, Santānavāṭikā, Haricandanavṛkṣavāṭikā, Mandāravāṭikā, Pārijātavāṭikā, Kadambavāṭī etc. On passing the seven walls, several houses are seen. They are topaz-house, jacinth-house, beryl-house, diamond-house, chrysoprase-house, sapphire-house, ruby-house, emeraldhouse, etc. (Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha 11)."
