Marriage was allowed to those who had completed education at the age of sixteen. (Samāvartana). Father or teacher teaches the pupil the Vedas and Vedāṅgas. When the education is completed the teacher or father makes him sit on a seat decorated with flowers, sandalwood etc. and do Godānavrata. Then he is offered Pañcāmṛta (milk, curd, butter, honey and water). This is called Samāvartana. With this his brahmacarya ends, and he is allowed to marry and lead the life of a house-holder. <dvsn n='NI'/>Marriage is a ceremony with four secondary rites Viz, Kanyādāna, Śacīyāga, Vivāha, Caturthīkarman. If the husband is dead, or lost, or has renounced the world, or has become a eunuch or is expelled from society, the woman is allowed to take another husband.
