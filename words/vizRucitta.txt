Viṣṇucitta had another name Periyālvār. Āṇḍāl who was famous among the Ālvārs was the daughter of Viṣṇucitta. <div n='NI'/>Viṣṇucitta sang holy hymns in praise of the beloved god. The hymns of praise he sang are called Pallāṇḍu. He got the name Periyālvār or the foremost of the devotees. <div n='NI'/>Once at Villiputtur, while he was getting beds ready to plant holy basil, he was attracted by a divine infant. It seemed to Viṣṇucitta that the little girl was lying among the basil plants. He took the child home and named her Godā. It was this Godā who became the famous Āṇḍāl later. Legends say that the birth of Āṇḍāl was in 97 Kali Era. Scholars say that Godā was born in the middle of 7th century. There is another story which mentions that Āṇḍāl was born from a portion of Goddess Earth."
