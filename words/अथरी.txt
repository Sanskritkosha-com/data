This word is given as an irregular derivation from अत् ‘to go constantly’; but it is more probable that it is derived, with aff. अरि, from an obsolete rad. अथ् which seems to have had the same meaning as अत् (cf. अट् and अठ्), but is found only in अथरी, अथर्वन् and their derivatives, implying quickness or agility. The same etymological connexion between words meaning ‘finger’ and ‘fire’ may be perceived in other derivations from a radical in the sense of ‘to go’ f. i. in अङ्गुलि or अङ्गुरि, अग्रू and अग्नि, अङ्गिरस्, from अङ्ग्. It reappears distinctly in the denom. अथर्य् and its derivatives अथर्य, अथर्यु qq. vv."
