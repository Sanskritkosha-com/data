This word occurs in the poem Ānandalaharī as the epithet of a serpent, to indicate that it is in profound sleep, forming, then, three ringlets and a half; the god Śiva is likened to a serpent coiled up in this manner, its half ringlet being compared to his Śakti or female energy and the three others to the god as representing the Trimūrti. E. अध्युष्ट and वलय."
