Not repeating the argument for discussion, i. e. a tacit agreement with it or assent to the assertion of the person who has proposed it; viz. if, after the argument for discussion has been announced, it has not been repeated by any one--the sign of taking it up--the proposer has to proclaim it three times; if then it does not meet with the anubhāṣana, it is considered as proved or as accepted as such. E. अ neg. and अनुभाषण."
