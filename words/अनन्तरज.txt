(-जः) The son of a man of the three first castes, married to a woman of a caste inferior in order to his own, but not to a Sūdra woman viz. of a Brāhmaṇa by a Kṣatriyā or Vaiśyā and of a Kṣatriyā by a Vaiśyā. The three kinds of sons got by parents of the same caste are called सजातिज and both, comprising six kinds, have the privileges of a Dvija or twice-born man. (This is the explanation given by a commentator of Manu and, according to him, अनन्तरज would have a different meaning than अनन्तरजात, though both words appear to be synonymes.) E. अनन्तर and ज."
