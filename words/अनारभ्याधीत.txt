(-तः-ता-तम्) Not read in connexion with chapters or books treating authoritatively on vaidik rites or sacrifices; said of passages, esp. in the Brāhmaṇas, which treat on rites, sacrifices &c. not to be connected with other passages with which they may happen to be found together, the injunctions of the latter not being applicable to those of the former. A ceremonial, for instance, taught in an anārabhyādhīta, would not be considered as the essential part of another ceremonial, treated in passages, called ārabhyādhīta, which may precede or follow it, nor share in the general rules concerning these; and it is, therefore, always the object of special rules which define its position amongst the other parts of the ritual and its applicability. E. अ neg. and आरभ्याधीत."
