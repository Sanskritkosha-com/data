Wrongly generalizing the predicament of perishableness i. e. a sophism on perishableness; viz. arguing perishableness from the reason that every thing is perishable because it shares in some qualities with other things which are perishable. E. अनित्य and सम (in the sense of जाति, sophism); the masc. form of this word is explained according to some, by the ellipsis of प्रतिषेध or contradiction, as a Sūtra in the Nyāya treating on a sophism is always followed by another containing the refutation; or, according to others, by the ellipsis of विकल्प (in the sense of विविधः कल्पः i. e. प्रकारः or variousness), there being various sophisms, viz. twenty-four; or according to others, by the ellipsis of प्रयोग i. e. a (logical) proceeding which likens or produces the plausibility of perishableness; or the word is taken as a Bahuvr. with the ellipsis of प्रयोग i. e. a logical proceeding in which perishableness is likened (viz. made plausible).As a feminine, °समा is taken in the sense of जाति, sophism."
