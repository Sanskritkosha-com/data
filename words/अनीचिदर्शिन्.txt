(The reading of this word is doubtful, and the correct form is probably अवीचिदर्शिन्; from अवीचि the last of the eight fiery hells of the Buddhists and दर्शिन्, ‘seeing’; as an Arhat, who has made himself conversant with the whole doctrine of Sākyamuni, is promised to penetrate with his sight all the worlds, ‘from the highest summit of existence, down to the great hell Avīchi’.)"
