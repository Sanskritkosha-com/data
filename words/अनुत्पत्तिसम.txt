The sophism of the impossibility of origin or birth; viz. arguing that a thing cannot take origin, because a thing exists in consequence of an immaterial cause; as the latter, however, does not exist before the material cause and the instance proving the existence of such material cause, and as the material cause again depends upon what exists, and the instance upon the material cause, the thing itself can never come into existence: or origin in general is impossible. E. अनुत्पत्ति and सम. (With respect to the gender of this word and the ellipsis required to explain it, see the E. of अनित्यसम.)"
