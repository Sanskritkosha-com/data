A sophism on non-perception; viz. arguing: ‘because the non-perception of an object cannot be perceived, therefore the non-perception of the object does not exist and consequently the non-existence of the object cannot exist i. e. the object itself must exist’. This sophism is attributed by the Nyāya e. g. to those who maintain the eternity of sound on the ground that ‘the non-perception of sound antecedently to pronunciation’--the reason alleged by the Nyāya for its non-eternity--may be refuted in the manner explained. E. अनुपलब्धि and सम (m. scil. प्रतिषेध or विकल्प or प्रयोग; f. scil. जाति; comp. for the meaning of these words the E. of अनित्यसम)."
