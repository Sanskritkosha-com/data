(-क्या) The name of such verses of the Ṛgveda as are recited by the priest Hotṛ (q. v.), when the deity is invoked by him to partake of the Havis or clarified butter. This word is found frequently together with याज्या (q. v.), the name of those hymns of the same Veda which are recited by the Hotṛ when the Havis-oblation is actually made. The Anuvākyās are spoken in a slow or as it were drawling tone, while the Yājyās are recited quickly. According to the Mīmānsā no priest but the Hotṛ is allowed to recite either of them. Compare also पुरोऽनुवाक्या and या- ज्यानुवाक्या. E. वच् with अनु, kṛtya aff. ण्यत्."
