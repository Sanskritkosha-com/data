            "content": "अनुवाद¦ Tatpur. m. (-दः) <sup>1</sup> Reference or referring to what has been previously said, not in the way of a mere repetition or tautology, but in that of explanation, detailed comment or emphasis; explanatory and corroborative reference, explanation; e. g. भूपरिधिमानानुवादः ‘a detailed explanation with reference to the measure of the earth's circumference (mentioned before in the Golādhyāya)’; or, in Manu 2. 53. the words खानि संस्पृशेत् are an अनुवाद to निवेद्य &c. 2. 51., because they give a detailed illustration of the general injunction contained in the latter verse. If a word is repeated or an expression used which would seem superfluous, because not conveying a new notion, such repeated word or such expression is अनुवाद, provided a certain purpose be connected with it, otherwise it would be simply पुनरुक्त or a meaningless tautology, e. g. घटो घटः or घटः कलसः ‘a jar is a jar’ would be a पुनरुक्त; but the repetition of पश्येत् in Yājnav. 2. 1. from 1. 359. is an अनुवादः because it points to the connexion between both passages and to the detail which is to follow as an illustration of 1. 359.; or in Manu 1. 72. परिसंख्यया might be taken as an अनुवाद to सहस्रं, because it imparts greater emphasis to the bare numeral. <sup>2</sup> In the ritual literature अनुवाद designates those passages of the Brāhmaṇa portion of the Vedas, which point to an injunction given before (विधि q. v.) and illustrate it by the way of comment, or by entering into greater detail, or by adding supplementary rules, but without stating the purpose of the injunction itself as the latter would be the object of the अर्थवाद (q. v.); the अनुवाद being accessory, therefore, to the विधि portion of the Brāhmaṇa and precluded from giving independent regulations, the supplementary rites they contain are not considered of equal weight and as absolute as those of the विधि; there exists however sometimes a difficulty to decide whether a passage of the Brāhmaṇas is विधि or अनुवाद, or in other words whether its injunctions are absolute or not, as appears from the discussion of the Mīmānsists. (The Nyāya, supported by the commentaries on the Mīmānsā, distribute the text of the Brāhmaṇa under the three heads of विधि, अनुवाद and अर्थवाद qq. vv.; a later division makes अनुवाद one of the three categories of the अर्थवाद.) <sup>3</sup> Report, e. g. कुत्सितार्थानुवादः. <sup>4</sup> Abuse, reviling (? this meaning is given by several dictionaries on the authority of the Śabdaratnāvalī, but, to judge from the Mss. at my disposal, it would seem to proceed from another reading or from a misunderstanding of the passage of this work which contains the synonymes of ‘rumour’: यथार्थानिश्चिता वार्त्ता भवेत्सर्वजनात्मिका । कुत्सितार्थानुवादो वा किंवदन्ती जनश्रुतिः ॥; the same might be said of the meanings ‘abusive reply’ and ‘divulging another's misdeeds’ which occur also in some dictionaries). E. वद् with अनु, kṛt aff. घञ् or अनु and वाद."
