In a sentence the  <lbinfo n='anu#vAdya'/> अनुवाद्य or subject which is supposed to be already known is repeated to mark its connection with the विधेय or predicate and should be placed first; अनुवाद्यमनुक्त्वैव न विधेयमुदीरयेत्; in वृद्धिरादैच् आदैच् should have been placed first, though the <lbinfo n='construc+tion'/> construction is defended by Patañjali."
