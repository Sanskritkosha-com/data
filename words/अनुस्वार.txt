            "content": "अनुस्वार¦ Tatpur. m. (-रः) (In Grammar.) Literally, an aftersound; the name of a nasal sound which always belongs to the preceding vowel and according to some is weaker, according to others stronger than the अनुनासिक q. v. In writing it is marked by a dot over the vowel after which it sounds. It shares in the nature as well of consonants as of vowels: of consonants, in as much as it has but half a measure of time (or मात्रा) and with another consonant makes position: of vowels, by having their properties of shortness, length, प्लुति q. v., and of being capable of accentuation. (The vaidik grammarians call the consonants and the Anusvāra the ‘body of a syllable’--अक्षराङ्ग--.) On account of the organ of speech with which it is pronounced it belongs to the नासिक्य q. v., and on account of the mode in which it is uttered to the ऊष्मन् q. v. (see also महाप्राण). If a combined consonant follows an Anusvāra the vaidik grammarians want the first consonant of the group to be repeated; e. g. सोमानं स्स्वरणं &c. instead of सोमानं स्वरणं &c.; this rule, however, is neglected in most of our vaidik Mss. and in all referring to the post-vaidik literature, although the injunction of the grammarians is doubtless founded on correct physiological observation and the system of Sanskrit orthography on a correct imitation in writing the spoken sound.--At the end of a पद (q. v.) Anusvāra is a substitute for म्, in the middle of a पद that of म् or न्; at the end of a पद it is only allowed to occur when the पद does not stand in a pause, and in the middle not before any other sound than श्, ष्, स and ह्, before which it is the compulsory substitute. (These rules, too, are frequently neglected in spite of the grammatical authorities.) It is compulsory, too, at the end of the पद, before the same letters and र् save a few exceptions as सम्राज् or when ह् is followed by म्, न् &c., e. g. किं ह्मलयति or किम्ह्मलयति, किं ह्नुते or किन्ह्नुते &c. For the interchange and the confusion, that prevails in the classical literature, between the use of Anusvāra and Anunāsika before य्, ल्, व् see s. v. अनुनासिक.--A short syllable followed by Anusvāra (which itself as results from the preceding statement must always be followed by a consonant) becomes of the nature of a long syllable, i. e. it becomes गुरु or heavy; but though this is the constant case in the Vedas and generally in the later literature, it will seem that this rule may be departed from at the end of a Pāda, as in the instance of the following first Pāda of the Āryā verse: अथ लुलितप- तत्रिमालं रुग्नासनवाणकेशरतमालम् &c. where त्रिमालं counts for ˘¯˘ |. (‘यद्यपि छन्दःशास्त्रे सानुस्वारस्य गुरुत्वमनुशिष्टं तथापि तथा पादान्तगोऽपि वेति वचनात्तस्य लघुत्वात्प्रथम- पादे द्वादश मात्रा भवन्ति’.) E. स्वृ with अनु, kṛt aff. घञ्."
