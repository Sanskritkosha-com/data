Indeterminate, going astray, non-absolute.--In the Nyāya and Vaiśeṣika philosophies a quality which constitutes one of the five हेत्वाभास (q. v.) or semblances of reason; in the Nyāya it is also called सव्यभिचार. A ‘semblance of reason’ ‘goes astray’ or is ‘indeterminate’, if the argument is either too general (साधारण) i. e. if it may be applied to the subject of conclusion and to an opposite one; e. g. ‘sound is eternal, because it is not the object of touch’ or ‘the hearth smokes, because it is fiery’; or not general enough (असा- धारण) i. e. if it is excluded from either; e. g. ‘sound is eternal because it has the properties of sound’; or non-exclusive (अनुपसंहारिन्) i. e. if the major may be predicated of any other notion; e. g. ‘every thing is eternal because it can be measured’ or ‘every thing can be named because it can be inferred’.
