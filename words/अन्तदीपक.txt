One of the alaṅkāras or modes of writing or speaking elegantly, a variety of the alaṅkāra दीपक q. v.; viz. when a variegated description reposes on, and is illustrated as it were by, a verb which is placed at the end of the sentence. (It would seem that the injunction of the principal rhetorical works according to which there must be several verbs and but one subject in a दीपक has not been considered as absolute, as results from this instance: स गिरिं तरुषण्डमण्डितं समवाप्य त्वरया लतामृगः । स्मितदर्शितकार्यनिश्चयः कपिसै- न्यैर्मुदितैरमण्डयत् where there is but one verb viz. अमण्ड- यत् which has the properties required in this दीपक. Compare also आदिदीपक, मध्यदीपक, प्रतीपदीपक and मालादी- पक.) E. अन्त and दीपक."
