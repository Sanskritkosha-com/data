            "content": "अन्नप्राशन¦ Tatpur. n. (-नम्) Giving food to eat, scil. to a child: the seventh of the ten essential rites enjoined to the the three first castes (see संस्कार); it ought to take place according to Āsvālāyana, Manu, Yājnavalkya &c. in the sixth month after a child's birth; according to Kātyāyana and his school in the sixth (or, according to some, in the eighth month) if the child is a boy, in the fifth or seventh, if it is a girl. According to Āsvālāyana a father, if he desire plenty (for his child?) ought to give it a soup or sauce made of goat's flesh (‘आजमन्नाद्यकामः’); if he desire holiness, a soup or sauce made of the flesh of a francoline patridge, called tittiri (‘तैत्तिरं ब्रह्मवर्चसकामः’); if he desire strength, boiled rice sprinkled over with very little clarified butter, but not fried in butter, as it would then not be moist (‘घृतौदनं तेजस्कामः’) [The restriction made by the comm. in his explanation of the word घृतौदन is not justified by himself, but countenanced by the gloss of Patanjali on a Vārttika (‘संप्रत्ययाच्च तदर्थाध्यवसानम्’) to Pāṇini II. 1. 34]; or if he have no particular desire, boiled rice mixed with curdled milk, honey and clarified butter (‘दधिमधुघृतमिश्रमन्नं प्राशयेत्’). [The word अन्न supplied at आज and तैत्तिर is, as the comm. observes, not to be taken there in its usual sense ‘boiled rice’ but in that of soup or sauce, व्यञ्जन.] When giving the food, whatever be its substance, the father speaks the verse: अन्नपतेऽन्नस्य नो देह्यनमीवस्य शुष्मिणः &c. (Vājas. Sanh. 11. 83.), if the child is a boy; if it is a girl, the ceremony is performed without the recital of the mantra (‘आवृतैव कुमार्यै’).According to the school of Kātyāyana the food varies still more according to the nature of the desires: that corresponding with the desire of eloquence is the flesh (probably the sauce made of the flesh of) a skylark (भरद्वाजी); with the desire of plenty, that of a partridge, called क- पिञ्जल; with the desire of quickness that of a fish; with the desire of long life that of the partridge called कृकणा; with the desire of holiness that of the Śaralī bird (आटी); with the desire of all the advantages mentioned before that of all these animals together; the dish must moreover in general contain honey, clarified butter and bits of gold (Reṇuka in his Gṛhyakārikā: ‘मध्वाज्यकनकोपेतं सर्वं तद्युग- पत्प्रभुः । मांसं तच्च भरद्वाज्या यदीच्छेद्वाक्प्रसारिताम् । का- पिञ्जलं चेदन्नाद्यं मात्स्यं च जवनं यदि । आयुश्चेत्कृकणायाश्च तदाट्याश्चेद्ब्रह्मवर्चसम् । सर्वं चेत्सर्वमांसानि सहान्नं प्राशयेच्छु- भम्’); the ceremony is performed while a mantra is inaudibly muttered and the child is sitting on the lap of its mother before the divinity of the family; preparatory procedings are, according to Reṇuka, those connected with the fixing of an auspicious day, the Ābhyudayika-śrāddha (the same as the Vṛddhi-Śr.), austerities, as suspending the breath, meditation on the divinity and oblations (āhutis) with clarified butter while remembering the divine powers of speech (वाच्), the vital airs प्राण and अपान, eye (चक्षुस्) and ear (श्रोत्र), lastly an oblation of चरु (q. v.) to Agni (अग्निः स्विष्टकृत्).--According to Bhavadeva, as quoted by Rādhākānta, the order of the procedings is: fixing of an auspicious day, ablutions, performance of the Vṛddhi-Śrāddha, collecting of the sacrificial fire, making a heap of Kuśagrass(?) (acc. to Reṇuka: of fifty leaves of this grass), then silently throwing into the fire a piece of fuel smeared with clarified butter, of a span's length, then the oblation (homa) which is accompanied with the three sacred words bhūr, bhuvar and svar, then five oblations (āhutis) with clarified butter, then the homa of the five vital airs (प्राण), or instead of the two latter(?) the ceremony practised in the north which begins with the Śāṭyāyanahoma and ends with the hymn called Vāmadevya; these procedings are followed by the essential rite of giving the food and by, what is essential too, the presents to the officiating priest.
