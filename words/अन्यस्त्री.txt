[In Rhetoric she is one of the three categories of the principal female character in a poetical composition (the two other being स्वस्त्री or स्वीया and साधारणस्त्री or सामान्यनायिका qq. vv.; the अन्यस्त्री or परकीया is either ‘another's wife’ or a ‘damsel’; as ‘another's wife’ ‘she is fond of festivals and the like opportunities, is a disgrace to her family, bare of modesty’; the ‘damsel’ is ‘one not yet married, bashful and arrived at the period of youth’. Each of these two has again eight subdivisions; ‘she may be one who has an obsequious lover, or one who is ill-treated, or one who goes after her lover, or one who is separated from him by a quarrel, or one who is neglected, or one whose lover is abroad, or one who is prepared in her house to receive him, or one who is longing in absence of her lover’).
