The sophism of the non-existence of qualities; viz. arguing, that because two things have one quality not in common, they will have none in common; e. g. sound and a jar being both artificially produced are perishable; now the sophism in question would consist in concluding: that because sound has not the quality of shape, which belongs to jar, or because a jar does not refer to the sense of hearing as sound does, sound and jar are neither artificially produced nor perishable. E. अपकर्ष and सम. (With respect to the gender of this word and the ellipsis required to explain it, see the E. of अनित्यसम.)"
