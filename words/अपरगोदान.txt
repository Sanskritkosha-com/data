One of the four dvīpas or continents which are in each of the innumerable earths, and the inhabitants of which have faces of the same shape as the continent in which they are born; the Aparagodāna is in shape like a round mirror and 7000 Yojanas in extent, on the west of the Mahāmeru which is in the centre of the earth and from its base to its summit 168,000 Yojanas in height; in this continent merit cannot be obtained. (Spence Hardy, Manual of Buddhism pp. 4. 449.) E. अपर and गोदान."
