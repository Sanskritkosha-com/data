[The gender of this word is neuter --comp. <i>Pāṇ.</i> V. 4. 98.--, not masc., as might be inferred from the present publication of so called <i>‘Extracts’</i> from <i>Sāyaṇa'</i>s comm. on the <i>Śatapathabr.,</i> in the passage III. 8. 3. 27; for although the Ms. 657 of the E. I. H. is very incorrect, it does not read सक्थ्यो, as has been alleged, but some other mutilated form intended probably for सक्थ्नोः; it runs literally thus: ऊर्वोरुपरि भूतौ उछ्रितावपवो (sic) साछ्र्यो । (the छ्य representing in this Ms. the value of थ्य and the आ-ओ that of ओ).] E. अपर (see I. 1. 3.) and सक्थि, samās. aff. टच्."
