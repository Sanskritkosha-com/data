In <ls>Divy</ls> 〔1.3〕; 〔18.6〕; 〔19.16, 19, 23〕; 〔21.2, 12〕 the <ab>mss.</ab> read corruptly, and with much variation, a text discussed by the editors on 〔p. 703〕; they read asmāt parāntaka- and interpret as a synonym of <b>pratyantima</b>, except in 〔19.19〕 where they read asmākam aparāntaka-, interpreting (with privative a-) as the opposite, <i>not distant, near</i>. The forms are troublesome; without much confidence I suggest that forms of aparāntaka may have been found in all, meaning something like <i>of the western border</i> (if not specifically <i>of the country Aparānta</i>). But <lang>Tib.</lang> (<ls>Bailey, JRAS</ls> 〔1950.172〕) on 〔19.19〕 points to <b>Aśmāparāntaka</b>, <ab>q.v.</ab>; and this seems to have been the regular <lang>Tib.</lang> form <ab>acc.</ab> to <ls>Schiefner</ls>, cited <ls>Divy</ls> 〔p. 703〕."
