(-तः-ता-तम्) Not cleaned with alkaline substances (as the garment of a man who is initiated for a sacrifice).--The present edition of the <i>Śatapathabr.</i> where the word occurs (III. 1. 2. 19.), gives it in the shape of अपल्पूलनकृत, but although it may be difficult sometimes to distinguish a य् from a प् in Devanāg. Mss., the form अपल्यू° is doubtless the correct one, since the reading of the radical पल्यूल् (wherefrom पल्यूलनं = शोधनद्रव्यम् Mādhava) is safe through its occurring also in Beṅgāli writing.E. अ neg. and पल्यूलन-कृत."
