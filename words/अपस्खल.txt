A place which is not a threshing floor or outside of a threshing floor; a place which is useless for the purpose of threshing or unchaffing rice &c.; the word is used in the <i>Śatapathabr.</i> I. 7. 3. 26. as a comparison to the Gārhapatya fire on which the clarified butter is not to be fried, this fire being unfit for such a purpose; for ‘like as grain heaped up outside of a threshing floor is to no purpose, in the same manner clarified butter fried in the Gārhapatya can produce no result’. E. अप and स्खल."
