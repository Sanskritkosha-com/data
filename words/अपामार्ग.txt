            "content": "अपामार्ग¦ Tatpur. m. (-र्गः) The name of a plant (Achyranthes aspera) which is employed for sacrificial purposes, it being supposed to have the power of removing sins, and also as a medicament; it has three varieties: the white, the red and the water-Apāmārga. The white variety is described as ‘a little pungent, hot, bitterish, astringent or constipating, emetic, pungent (sic), increasing the digestion, or stomachic, and applied against diseases from phlegm, the itch, piles, diseases of the stomach, of the blood, of serous secretions, of the vital airs, against cutaneous eruptions, leprosy, indolent tumors and nausea’--; the red variety is ‘a little pungent, cold, constipating, emetic, obstructing the circulation of the vital air, and rough; it is employed against diseases from phlegm and of the vital airs, against ulcers, itch, and poison; its seed or fruit is cold, sweet, indigestive whether raw or cooked, constipating, causing flatulency, rough, emetic and good for cough and hemorrhages from the mouth, nose, rectum and cuticle’; the water-variety is ‘pungent and used against pulmonary consumption, swellings, diseases from phlegm and of the vital airs, and against cough’.--The ashes of the plant are used in cleaning linen. E. मृज् with अप, kṛt aff. घञ्, the final vowel of the prefix being lengthened; (or according to <i>Bhānud.</i> on the <i>Amarak.,</i> a Bahuvr. अप and आ-मार्ग; ‘अपमार्जन्त्यनेन…, अप- कृष्ट आसमन्तान्मार्गोऽस्येति वा’; but according to <i>Rāyam.</i> only the former: ‘अपमृजन्ति वस्त्रादिकमनेन’; and equally so the <i>Siddhāntak.</i> ‘अपमृज्यतेऽनेन व्याधादिः’, and the <i>Kā-</i> <i>śikā</i> which quotes अपामार्ग, besides वीमार्ग as an instance to <i>Pāṇ.</i> VI. 3. 122.)."
