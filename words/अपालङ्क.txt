(The <i>Sid-</i> <i>dhāntakaum.</i> in its chapter, the फिट्सूत्र, gives the word only in its crude form, whence the masc. gender could not be established; in the E. I. H. Ms. No. 98 of these Sūtras the comm. writes once अपालङ्का and another time अपालङ्कः, the latter being probably the correct form, to judge from the synonymes and the form पालङ्क which seems kindred to it.)"
