A religious act which is not performed on account of the gratification of the sacrificer, but because it is essential to the sacrifice itself; see क्रत्वर्थ. <sup>2</sup> (In the Sāṅkhya philos.) Not the chief object of the Soul; occurring in the Sūtras in its abstract deriv. अपुरुषार्थत्व; e. g. अपुरुषार्थत्वमुभयथा ‘in neither way is (nihilism) the chief end of the Soul’; or नानुश्राविकादपि तत्सिद्धिः साध्यत्वेनावृत्तियोगादपुरुषार्थत्वम् ‘the accomplishment thereof (i. e. of liberation) does not arise, moreover, from scriptural means, for since transmigration is connected with the result (of religious acts, the performance of such acts) is not the chief object of the Soul’; or सुखलाभाभावादपुरुषार्थत्वमिति चेन्न द्वैविध्यात् ‘if you reason that, since there is no such a thing as obtaining happiness, (final liberation as the absence of pain) is not the chief object of the Soul, you are wrong, for its object is twofold (viz. obtaining happiness and not having pain)’. E. अ neg. and पुरुषार्थ."
