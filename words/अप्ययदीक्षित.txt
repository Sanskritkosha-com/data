(-तः) The name of a celebrated Dravida Brahmaṇa, the son of <i>Nārāyaṇadīkṣita;</i> he lived at Agrahara and flourished in the 16<sup>th</sup> century of Śālivāhana; his contemporaries considered him as an emanation of Śiva on account of his devotion for this god and his great learning, for ‘at the age of twelve years he perfectly studied the Vedas and was besides master of several abstruse sciences’. In his crusade for establishing the superiority of Śivaism he was once waylayed in a forest by ruffians, hired by one of his unvictorious opponents at the court of Vankatapati, but rescued by timely aid. He died at Chillumbrum, as it appears, at the age of ninety. He is said to be the author of 84 books on theology, rhetoric and philosophy. <i>Colebrooke</i> names (essays I. 333. 337) two of his Vedānta works; <i>Wilson</i> (in the introd. to the <i>Daśakumārach.</i> p. 5) his abridged version of the first portion of the Daśak. and his work on rhetoric, the <i>Kuvālayānanda</i> (comp. also Journal As. serie IV. vol. XI. p. 529); a vocabulary of his is mentioned in <i>Weber'</i>s Catalogue of the Berlin Sanskr. Ms. (No. 806), and the Pandit <i>Cavelly Ven-</i> <i>kata Rāmasvāmin</i> who is answerable for the data alleged before, enumerates among his Śivaitic writings the <i>Śivār-</i> <i>chanā-chandrikā, Śiva-tattwa-viveka, Śiva-maṇi-dīpika</i> and the <i>Ātmārpaṇa.</i>--His name occurs also in the shape of अप्यायदीक्षित, अप्यैदीक्षित, अप्यदीक्षित, अप्पिदीक्षित, अप्प- दीक्षित, अप्यय्य; but he is not the same as अप्प q. v. E. अप्यय and दीक्षित."
