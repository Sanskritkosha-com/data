One of the अलङ्कार q. v. or elegant modes of composition; viz. implied or indirect expression (literally: conveying--the subject matter--by what is not the subject matter); more especially defined as conveying the subject matter, if it is of a specific nature by means of generalisation, or if it is of a general kind, by means of specification, or if it is viewed as a cause, by stating the effect, or if it is viewed as an effect, by stating the cause, or hinting at the subject matter by stating what is similar to it, (the latter category being divided in two varieties which are again split in two other varieties; while each of the named categories may be, moreover, threefold, according to whether the expressed special or general subject, fact, cause or similarity is of a real or imaginary or mixed nature); an instance of the second category is the following: स्रगियं यदि जीवितापहा हृदये किं निहिता न हन्ति माम् । विषमप्यमृतं क्वचिद्भवेदमृतं वा विषमीश्वरेच्छया, where the <i>general</i> idea that the will of God may turn evil into good and good into evil, is conveyed by the special instance of poison and amṛta. E. अप्रस्तुत and प्रशंसा."
