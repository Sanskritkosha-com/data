Residing in the intermediate region, in the region between heaven and earth, viz. the eleven gods which form one class, besides the class of eleven gods which reside in heaven, and another class of eleven gods which reside over the earth. (An interpretation ‘residing in the waters’ has been applied to these gods probably in order to suggest what Hindu mythology <i>ought</i> to have been, but it is neither countenanced by Sāyaṇa nor by Mahīdh. nor by any other authority.) E. अप्सु (loc. of अप् 2.) and क्षित्."
