(The meaning ‘moon’ is not given in the Koshas; but as the word occurs in the second meaning, in a mathematical Index, similarly as अमृतदीधिति, and as the synonymes of चन्द्र q. v. are used likewise so, it seemed to me necessary to infer this mathematical application from the meaning ‘moon’, which would arise from the etymon of the word in the same way as अब्ज 2. 1. q. v. Comp. also श्वे- तधामन् ‘moon and cuttle fish bone’.) <div n='P'><sup>b.</sup> m. du.
