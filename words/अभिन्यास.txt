A variety of fever, viz. a mixed remittent or synochus fever, supposed to be produced by the morbid state of the three temperamental elements, air, bile and phlegm collectively; the patient is described by <i>Suśruta</i> as ‘being neither too warm nor too cold, not quite conscious, wandering in his mind, hoarse, with a sharp taste, dry throat, void of perspiration and not having the natural excretions, hiccupping, without appetite, dull, panting (or sighing), lying prostrate, impeded in speech, drowsy and with contracted limbs’; the cure of this fever is believed either very difficult or impossible. It is also called हतौजस्, as the patient looses his strength by this fever, or from the ‘combination’ of the causes which produce it, सन्निपातज्वर, सर्वात्मकज्वर, सर्वदोषसमुत्थज्वर, सर्वजज्वर, सर्वज्वर. E. अस् (cl. 4.) with नि and अभि, kṛt aff. घञ्; scil. ज्वर."
