            "content": "अभिवादन¦ Tatpur. n. (-नम्) Respectful salutation of a superior or elder, especially of a Guru, by a junior or inferior for the sake of obtaining his blessing; (<i>Vīramitr. Āchāraprak.:</i> अ- भिवादननाम वटोरात्मानमभि गुरोराशीर्वचनानुकूलो व्यापा- रः). It consists of three acts, viz. 1. the प्रत्युत्थान or rising from the seat, 2. the उपसंग्रहण or पादोपसंग्रहण, the peculiar mode of Hindu obeisance, and 3. the अभिवाद or the uttering of the formula of salutation. <div n='P'><sup>a.</sup> The first act is indispensable on the part of the person whose duty it is to make the salutation, whatever be the quality of the person saluted (<i>Āpastamba:</i> सर्वत्र तु प्रत्युत्था- याभिवादनम्); but the two other acts undergo various modifications according to the rank or quality of the person saluted and the person saluting. <div n='P'><sup>b.</sup> With regard to the उपसंग्रहण or the obeisance, the general rule is, according to <i>Manu,</i> that the saluter should with crossed hands (<i>comm.:</i> the right hand being placed over the left) clasp the feet of his <i>Guru,</i> touching the left foot with his left, and the right foot with his right, hand; (<i>Manu:</i> व्यस्तपाणिना कार्यमुपसंग्रहणं गुरोः । सव्येन सव्यः स्प्रष्टव्यो दक्षिणेन च दक्षिणः); the same injunction is given by <i>Āśvalāyana</i> and <i>Baudhāyana</i> with the addition that he should first touch, with composure of mind, his own left ear with his left and his right ear with his right, hand, and then make his bow, in the indicated manner, by touching his Guru from the knees to the feet; (<i>Āśvalāy.:</i> वामं वामेन संस्पृश्य दक्षिणेन तु दक्षिणम् । हस्तेन कर्णं हस्ताभ्यां गुरूणामभिवादनम् । वामोपरि करं कृत्वा दक्षिणं नाम चो- च्चरेत् । जानुप्रभृति पादान्तमारभ्य पादयोर्नमेत्; <i>Baudhāy.:</i> श्रोत्रे संस्पृश्य मनः समाधायाधस्ताज्जान्वोरा पद्भ्यामित्युपसंग्र- हणम्); according to some, his hands must be made hollow, when he touches the feet of the Guru and he is forbidden, under the threat of loosing the benefit of all his pious actions, to perform this act only with one hand (<i>Paīṭhīnasi:</i> उत्तानाभ्यां पाणिभ्यां दक्षिणेन दक्षिणं सव्येन सव्यं पादमभिवादयेत्; <i>Viṣṇu:</i> अजाकर्णेन विदुषां मूर्खाणामेकपा- णिना; <i>Vīramitr.</i> on the latter: श्रोत्रसमौ करौ कृत्वा पुनर- जाकर्णवत्संपुटितेन करद्वयेनेत्यर्थः; <i>Viṣṇu:</i> जन्मप्रभृति यत्किं- चिच्चेतसा धर्ममाचरेत् । सर्वं तन्निष्फलं याति एकहस्ताभिवा- दनात्); <i>Āpastamba</i> enjoins, on his part, that a Brāhmaṇa when saluting should raise his right arm as far as his ears, a Kshatriya as far as his breast (or according to a v. 1. as far as his shoulder), a Vaiśya as far as his navel and that a Sūdra making his obeisance should hold it down (<i>Āpast.:</i> स्वं दक्षिणं बाहुं श्रोत्रसमं प्रसार्य ब्राह्मणोऽभिवादयेतोरःसमं राजन्यो मध्यसमं वैश्यो नीचैः शूद्रः प्राञ्जलिः; <i>Vīram.</i> on the latter: अंससमं राजन्य इत्यपि पाठः । मध्यं नाभिः; <i>Atri,</i> however, seems to reserve this mode of salutation for a learned Brāhmaṇa in general, while he enjoins the touching of the feet, if the person saluted is a Guru; दक्षिणं पाणिमुद्धृत्य प्रकाममभिवादयेत् । श्रोत्रिये त्वञ्जलिः कार्यः पादोपग्रहणं गु- रोरिति). If the person to be saluted is a woman, the politeness of touching her from the knees to the feet is subject to some restrictions: if she is the wife of the <i>Guru,</i> but not of the same class as her husband, <i>Manu</i> and other legislators dispense with it altogether; if she is of the same class and the student is young, he must pay her that respect only when he returns from a journey, on other occasions he prostrates himself before her at his daily salutation, (<i>Vīram.</i> on <i>Manu</i> 2. 217. and <i>Gautama:</i> विप्रोष्येति व- चनान्न प्रत्यहमिति गम्यते); but if she is young and the young man knows already to distinguish right from wrong which is the case when he has completed his twentieth year (according to <i>Manu;</i> or his sixteenth year, according to the <i>Vīram.</i> on <i>Gautama</i>) he must never touch her feet but always prostrate himself before her; <i>Manu</i> enjoins further that the sister of his mother, the wife of his maternal uncle, his own wife's mother and the sister of his father must be treated by him like the wife of his Guru, equally so the wife of his brother (<i>comm.:</i> the eldest wife, of the same class), and that the sister of his father and of his mother as well as his own elder sister must be saluted in the same manner as his mother, but that his paternal and maternal kinswomen are to be greeted by touching their feet only on his return from a journey. <i>Gautama'</i>s rule that the wives of a brother and one's own wife's mother are never to be touched in this manner is restricted by the <i>Vīramitrodaya</i> to the wives of the same class (<i>Gaut.:</i> नोप- संग्रहणं भ्रातृभार्याणां श्वश्र्वाश्च; <i>Viram.:</i> यन्नोप°° इति गौत- मवाक्यं तदसवर्णाविषयम्), and when the same legislator enjoins that with the exception of a mother, the wife of a paternal uncle and a sister, no woman must be touched by her feet in being greeted except on the return from a journey, the same commentator infers that this ceremony is obligatory on the latter occasion (<i>Gautama:</i> नाविप्रोष्य स्त्रीणाममातृपितृव्यभार्याभागिनीनाम्; <i>Vīram.:</i> अविप्रोष्येति वचनाद्विप्रोष्य तु पादोपसंग्रहणं कर्तव्यमेव). <div n='P'><sup>c.</sup> The formula of salutation consists in general, if the person greeted is a man, of the word अभिवादये ‘I greet’, followed by the declaration of the saluter's own name and ending with the reverential word भोः (<i>Manu:</i> अभिवादात्परं विप्रो ज्यायांसमभिवादयन् । असौ नामाहमस्मीति स्वं नाम परिकीर्तयेत् ।…भोःशब्दं कीर्तयेदन्ते स्वस्य नाम्नोऽभि- वादने । नाम्नां स्वरूपभावो हि भोभाव ऋषिभिः स्मृतः); e. g. अभिवादये देवदत्तोऽहं भोः, or अभिवादय इन्द्रवर्माहं भोः, or अभिवादय इन्द्रपालितोऽहं भोः, or (if a woman greets) e. g. अभिवादये गार्ग्यहं भोः; according to the <i>Vīram.,</i> some combine with the declaration of the name also that of the family and the descendants when the word अभिवादये is placed at the end of the salutation, e. g. अमुकप्रवरोऽमुकगोत्रोऽमुक- शर्माहं भो भिवादये ‘father of such and such a son, descendant of such and such a family, I, such and such a…sarman, (e. g. कृष्णशर्मन्) Sir, greet (thee)’; if husband and wife salute there is no other restriction (<i>Gaut.:</i> स्त्रीपुंयोगेऽभिवादतो ऽनियममेके), but the formula becomes shortened in this way: अभिवादये गार्ग्यहं गार्गशर्माहं भोः. If the person saluted is a woman or a Śūdra or a man who either does not understand the Sanskṛt meaning of the proper name or does not know the proper manner of protracting the final vowel of the name in the return of the salutation or is otherwise ignorant of the proper manner of returning it (see g.), the formula of the saluter is simply thus: ‘अभिवादयेऽहम्’ ‘I greet’, such an address being not considered an अभिवादन; (<i>Vī-</i> <i>ram.</i> on <i>Manu.</i> 2. 123. and 126.: नामधेयस्याभिवादनिकस्या- भिवादमभिवादनवाक्यार्थत्वं ये न जानते तान्स्त्रीं च प्रत्यह- मिति लौकिकं नाम चोच्चरेत्प्राज्ञो न पूर्वोक्तमभिवादनवाक्यम् । यद्वा नामधेयस्याभिवादकनाम्नोऽन्तेऽभिवादं प्लुताकारारिकं न जानते तान्प्रतीति द्वेधा मेधातिथिर्व्याचख्यौ; <i>Medhātithi</i> referring to the Śūtra and Vārttikas of <i>Pāṇini</i> VIII. 2. 83.). [<i>Medhātithi</i> and <i>Govindarāja</i> take the word नाम in the passage of Manu quoted above in its literal sense and give the formula; e. g. <i>Medhāt.:</i> अभिवादये देवदत्तनामाहं भोः, but this mode of salutation is not approved of by other authorities; e. g. <i>Kullūka</i> in reference to this use of नामन्: मेधातिथिगोविन्दराजयोरभिधानमप्रमाणम्.] <div n='P'><sup>d.</sup> The general rule that prevails at a salutation is that the person who receives it must be an ‘elder’ or what is technically termed a <i>Guru</i> and that the person who pays it must be a ‘youth’ or an inferior; such a salutation may be of course occasional, but it is a duty of a youth to salute his ‘elders’ or ‘Gurus’ every morning after he has managed the consecrated fire (<i>Yājnav.:</i> अग्निकार्यं ततः कुर्यात्संध्ययोरुभयोरपि ॥ ततोऽभिवादयेद्वृद्धानसावहमि- ति ब्रुवन्; <i>Yama:</i> ततोऽभिवादयेद्वृद्धानग्निकार्यादनन्तरम्; <i>Gautama:</i> गुरोः पादोपसंग्रहणं प्रातः).--For the persons comprised under the name गुरु and their relative superiority or inferiority see s. v., it may suffice here to give the definition of <i>Devala</i> who enumerates as male Gurus: the teacher (see उपाध्याय), the father, the eldest brother, the king, the maternal and paternal uncle, the father-in-law, an initiated householder, the maternal and paternal grandfather, and the eldest of the same class; as female Gurus: the mother, the maternal and paternal grandmother, the sisters of father and mother, the mother-in-law, and the old nurse; and to add from the definition of others the priest (see ऋत्विज्) and the spiritual teacher (see आचार्य). If there are several persons present who have a claim to a salutation, the teacher who has given instruction either on worldly or ritual or spiritual matters, has precedence before all others, according to <i>Manu</i> (लौकिकं वैदिकं चापि तथाध्यात्मिकमेव च । आददीत यतो ज्ञानं तं पूर्वमभिवादयेत्), and, in general, every superior Guru has precedence before the one next to him in degree. [In the passage of <i>Gautama:</i> पादोपसंग्रहणं गुरुसमवायेऽन्वहम् । अभिगम्य तु विप्रोष्य मा- तृपितृतद्बन्धूनां (i. e. mother, father, maternal uncle and aunt, paternal uncle and aunt &c.) पूर्वजानां (i. e. elder brothers &c.) विद्यागुरूणां (i. e. the Upādhyāya, Āchārya &c.) तत्त- द्गुरूणां च (i. e. their maternal or paternal grandfathers &c.) संनिपाते परस्य, the last word (परस्य) does not imply that each <i>following</i> precedes in rank each preceding, but means each <i>superior; Vīram.:</i> मात्रादीनां पुरा यत्संनिपाते समागमे परस्योत्कृष्टस्य प्रथममुपसंग्रहणं कर्तव्यम्.] The term ‘youth’ mentioned above is not to be taken in its literal, but in its metaphorical sense; for <i>Manu</i> rules that fellow citizens are equal (as to age) for ten years, dancers and singers for five, learned theologians for three, but persons related by blood for a very short time; again, that one must consider a Brāhmaṇa though but ten years old, as if he were the father of a Kshatriya though aged a hundred years; therefore a friend, e. g., is not to be addressed with the words भोः or भवत्, unless he be older than ten years, and a Brāhmaṇa must never salute first a Kshatriya or a man of a lower class, however distinguished he be (<i>Vīram.:</i> दशवर्षाधिककः सखा भोभवच्छब्दाभ्यां संबोध्यः; <i>Śātātapa:</i> नाभिवाद्यास्तु वि- प्रेण क्षत्रियाद्याः कथंचन । ज्ञानकर्मगुणोपेता यद्यप्येते बहुश्रु- ताः); for if he does so, he incurs severe spiritual penalties. <div n='P'><sup>e.</sup> Persons not to be saluted are, according to <i>Manu, Gau-</i> <i>tama, Baudhāyana:</i> a priest (<i>Ṛtvij</i>), a wife's father, a maternal and paternal uncle, learned and pious persons, <i>if they are</i> <i>younger;</i> they are merely to be addressed with the words ‘I, so and so, am here’ असावहम्, and to be honoured by rising from the seat; this ceremony does not constitute, therefore, an अभिवादन. [In <i>Manu</i> 2. 130. the word गुरून् is to be taken in the sense of ‘an elder by learning and piousness’; it does not occur in the corresponding passages of <i>Gautama</i> and <i>Baudh.;</i> the former: ऋत्विक्श्वशुरपितृव्यमातुलानां तु य- वीयसां प्रत्युत्थानमनभिवाद्याः; the latter with the same words except for the last, प्रत्युत्थायाभिभाषणम्.] In law courts, in houses of penance and palaces where Brāhmaṇas are assembled, the latter are not to be saluted individually, but the words सर्वेभ्यो नमः ‘respect to all’ are to be addressed to the whole assembly; this mode of address is called the नमस्कार which is different therefore from the अभिवादन; (<i>Viṣṇu:</i> सभासु चैव सर्वासु यज्ञराजगृहेषु च नमस्कारं न कुर्वीत ब्राह्मणं ना- भिवादयेत्; <i>Vīram.</i> on those words: सर्वासु धर्मव्यवहारप्रा- यश्चित्तादिनिर्णयसभासु नमस्कारं न कुर्यात् । प्रत्येकमिति शे- षः । किं तु सर्वेभ्यो नम इत्येव वक्तव्यम्; <i>Vṛhadviṣṇu:</i> सभां नाभिवादयेत्); <i>Āpastamba</i> forbids to salute a man who carries fuel, flowers, kuśa grass, fire, water and rice in his hands and one who performs the Japahoma; <i>Kātyāyana:</i> a wicked man, a cripple, a stranger, one who has enemies after him, a diseased person, a Yogin, one bent upon doing penance and a youngster (similarly <i>Vṛhaspati</i>); <i>Śatā-</i> <i>tapa:</i> a heretic, an outcaste (पतित), a Vrātya (q. v.), a person while his head is oiled, while eating, yawning, cleansing his teeth, performing his natural functions &c.; the <i>Vṛhadnāradīya:</i> an atheist, a libertine (भिन्नमर्याद), an impious man, a thief and a cheat, a man fond of litigation, a drunken man, one who vomits or stands in water, one who carries rice given to him as alms or one who is in a lying position, one who performs a Śrāddha, a vow or a sacrifice; amongst <i>women Śātātapa</i> forbids to greet: one in her courses, one recently delivered, one who has killed her husband and one who has miscarried. <div n='P'><sup>f.</sup> A man must not salute, according to <i>Āpastamba,</i> while he has his shoes on, while his head is covered (वेष्टितशि- राः) and while his hands are stretched out; according to <i>Śaṅkha,</i> while he carries water in his hands, while he is unclean, performs funeral rites or is in a lying position …, according to <i>Baudhāyana,</i> while he carries fuel, a water-jug, flowers or rice. <div n='P'><sup>g.</sup> The return of the salutation or the प्रत्यभिवादन consists, generally, in uttering first the words आयुष्मान्भव सौम्य ‘long mayst thou live, friend’ or similar words to the same effect; (<i>Manu:</i> आयुष्मान्भव सौम्येति वाच्यो विप्रो ऽभिवादने, where the word इति indicates, according to <i>Me-</i> <i>dhātithi</i> and the <i>Vīramitrodaya,</i> that the preceding words are merely an illustration of the phrase to be used; thus the address may be worded also in this manner: आयुष्मानेधि or दीर्घायुर्भूयाः or चिरं जीव &c.); these words are followed by the name of the person who has greeted first and, if the latter is a Brāhmaṇa, the last vowel of his name, which at the same time is the last vowel of the whole phrase, becomes protracted (according to the general rules on making vowels प्लुत q. v.); some require moreover, that the name should always receive the addition of the word शर्मन्, others, however, consider this addition unnecessary (<i>Manu:</i> अका- रश्चास्य नाम्नोऽन्ते वाच्यः पूर्वाक्षरः प्लुतः; <i>Vīram.:</i> तत्र नामै- वेति केचित् । शर्मान्तमित्यपरे); the return of the salute to a Brāhmaṇa would therefore run on the following pattern: आयुष्मान्भव सौम्य देवदत्ता३, or आयुष्मान्भव सौम्य देवद- त्तशर्मा ३ न्, or आयुष्मान्भव पिणाकपाणा ३ इ (= पिणाक- पाणे), or …विष्णा ३ उ (= विष्णो), or आयुष्मानेधि … &c.; (the omission of the word शर्मन् when it originally belongs to the name, or the omission of the name altogether are rebuked by <i>Kullūka</i>). If the person thus addressed is a Kshatriya or Vaiśya or if the word भोः is added after the name (which seems permitted according to <i>Kātyāyana</i> on <i>Pāṇ.</i> VIII. 2. 83., although <i>Patanjali</i> observes that other authorities do not approve of the combination of the name <i>and</i> भोः, but allow only the enunciation of the one or the other), the protraction of the vowel is optional; e. g. in returning the salute to a Kshatriya: आयुष्मानेधीन्द्रवर्मा ३ न् or …°वर्मन्, to a Vaiśya: आयुष्मानेधीन्द्रपालिता ३ or …°पालित; or with भोः, आयुष्मानेधि देवदत्त भोः ३ or …भोः (but the latter phrase should be, according to the above mentioned observation, either आयुष्मानेधि भोः ३ or …देवदत्ता ३); if the person addressed is a woman or a Śūdra or spoken to in contempt or derision, no protraction of the vowel takes place, e. g. a woman: आयुष्मती भव गार्गि; a Śūdra: आयुष्मानेधि तुषजक; or in contempt: आ- युष्मानेधि स्थालिन् (<i>Patanjali:</i> असूयकस्त्वमसि जाल्म । न त्वं प्रत्यभिवादनमर्हसि । भिद्यस्व वृषल स्थालिन्; <i>Kaiyyaṭa:</i> असू- यकः प्रत्याचष्टे । प्रत्यभिवादवाक्यान्तस्थस्य नाम्नो गोत्रस्य च प्लुत इष्यते नान्यस्येति यौगिकस्य प्लुतो न विधेयः । तत्र प्रत्य- भिवादयित्रा स्थालिशब्दं संज्ञां मत्वा प्लुतो विहितः । यदा तू- पहासार्थमसूयकस्तमाक्षिपति तदासौ प्रत्यभिवादं नार्हत्याशी- र्वचनं हि प्रत्यभिवादो गृह्यते । प्रतिसंभाषणमात्रं तु प्रत्यभिवादं मत्वा वार्त्तिककृतासूयके प्रतिषेध उक्तः; in phrases such as देवदत्त कुशल्यसि, देवदत्त आयुष्मानेधि which are not worded in the proper manner in which the return of a salutation should be made, since the name does not stand at the end of the sentence, the protraction of the vowel is equally prohibited).--If the person to whom the salutation is to be returned, has performed the preparatory observances of a sacrifice, his name should not be enounced but in its place the reverential word भोः; and to the wife of another or to any woman not related by blood the epithet of address should be भवति or सुभगे or भगिनि (according to <i>Manu</i>). After the person has returned the greeting, he may put the usual polite questions, after the saluter's health &c.; (it is not therefore the latter who asks after the health &c. of the person who returns the salute, for <i>Govindarāja</i> who expresses that opinion, is rebuked for it by <i>Kullūka</i>); the model, however, laid down by <i>Manu</i> and <i>Āpastamba,</i> that a Brāhmaṇa must be asked whether he prospers, a Kshatriya whether he is quite well, a Vaiśya whether he is happy, and a Śūdra whether he is free from disease (<i>Manu:</i> ब्राह्मणं कुशलं पृच्छेत्क्षत्रबन्धुमनामयम् । वैश्यं क्षेमं समागम्य शूद्रमारोग्यमेव च; <i>Āpastamba:</i> कुशलमवरवयसं समानवयसं वा विप्रं पृच्छेत् । अनामयं क्षत्रियं क्षेमं वैश्यमारोग्यं शूद्रम्) is not to be taken in its literal sense, as the commentators observe and as may be inferred from instances in the epic and dramatic literature; thus in the <i>Sabhāparvan</i> of the <i>Ma-</i> <i>hābhārata, Nārada</i> after having returned the salute of <i>Yu-</i> <i>dhishthira</i> does not content himself with the question whether the king is quite well, but overwhelms him with an interrogatory of 110 Slokas (v. 151-260) which is perhaps the completest of its kind, though probably an overdone illustration of this part of a Hindu greeting. <div n='P'><sup>b.</sup> The object of the प्रत्यभिवादन being a blessing (<i>Viṣṇu:</i> शिष्याणामाशिषं दद्यात्पादोपग्रहणो गुरुः and compare the commencement of this article), a person who omits to return the salutation is threatened by <i>Yama</i> to become guilty of all the sins of the person he ought to have greeted (अभिवादे तु यः पूर्वमाशिषं न प्रयच्छति । यद्दुष्कृतं भवेत्तस्य तस्माद्भागं प्रपद्यते), by <i>Angiras</i> to fall into hell and by the <i>Bhavishya-Purāṇa</i> moreover, if the person thus slighted is a Brāhmaṇa, to be reborn in a future life as a tree on a cemetery which will be inhabited by vultures and crows; (<i>Bhav.-Pur.:</i> अभिवादे कृते यस्तु न करोत्यभिवादनम् । आशिषं वा न कुर्वीत स याति नरकं ध्रुवम् । अभिवादे कृते यस्तु तं विप्रं नाभिवादयेत् । श्मशाने जायते वृक्षो गृध्रकाकनिषेवितः).<div n='P'><sup>i.</sup> As a reward for performing properly and habitually the ceremony of a salutation <i>Manu</i> promises an increase of life, wisdom, fame and strength (अभिवादनशीलस्य नित्यं वृद्धोपसेविनः । चत्वारि संप्रवर्धन्त आयुर्विद्या यशो बलम्) and the Buddhistic work <i>Dhammapāda</i> which has modified the quoted verse, an increase of life, beauty, happiness and strength (अभिवादनशीलस्स निच्चं वद्धापचायिनो । चत्तारो धम्मा वड्ढन्ति आयु वण्णो सुखं बलं).
