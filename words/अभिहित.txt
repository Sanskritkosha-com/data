The  <lbinfo n='anvitā+bhidhānavādins'/> <i>anvitābhidhānavādins</i> (the Mīmāṃsakas, the followers of Prabhākara) hold that words only express a meaning (अभिधान) as parts of a <lbinfo n='sen+tence'/> sentence and grammatically connected with one another (अन्वित); that they, in fact, only imply an action or something connected with an action; <i><ab>e. g.</ab></i> घटं in घटं आनय means not merely ‘jar’, but ‘jar’ as <lbinfo n='con+nected'/> connected with the action of ‘bringing’ expressed by the verb. The  <lbinfo n='abhihi+tānvayavādins'/> <i>abhihitānvayavādins</i> (the Naiyāyikas, or the followers of Kumārila who hold the same doctrine) on the other hand hold that words by <lbinfo n='them+selves'/> themselves can express their own <lbinfo n='in+dependent'/> independent meanings which are <lbinfo n='after+wards'/> afterwards combined into a sentence expressing one connected idea; that, in other words, it is the logical <lbinfo n='con+nection'/> connection between the words of a <lbinfo n='sen+tence'/> sentence, and not the sense of the words themselves, that suggests the import or purport of that sentence; they thus believe in a <i>tātparyārtha</i> as distinguished from <i>vāchyārtha</i>; see <ls>K.
