            "content": "अभीर¦ Tatpur. 1. m. (-रः) A cowherd. ‘According to Manu (X. 15.) the <i>Abhīra</i> is of mixed origin, the offspring of a Brāhmaṇa father and a mother of the Ambashtha or medical caste; but the <i>Abhīras</i> were a people, a pastoral tribe, settled about the beginning of the Christian era, on or near the lower course of the Indus on a tract known to classical geographers, as the <i>Abiria</i> of Ptolemy, lying north of the Sahyadri mountain and of Syrastrene. The <i>Abhīras</i> of Saurāṣtra are mentioned in the Mahābhārata. From their pastoral habits the name came to be generally applied to the cowherds of Hindustan. In the spoken dialects of upper India the word is corrupted to Ahīr, Uheer; in Bengālī and Marāṭhī it is unchanged, occurring as Abhīr.’ (<i>Wilson'</i>s <i>Glossary of Indian Terms.</i>) See <i>Lassen'</i>s <i>Ind. Alt.</i> vol. 1. pp. 106. 396. 539. 546. 705. 798. 799. 823; II. pp. 385. 547. 553. 592. 792. 855. 953. 956. &c.--The word as a name of a people occurs in the Purāṇas ‘always conjoined with the <i>Śūdras,</i> as if conterminous’ (<i>Wilson'</i>s <i>Viṣṇu-P.</i> p. 195 n. 154).--The <i>Sāhityadarpaṇa</i> mentions the <i>Abhīras</i> as assistants appointed in, or belonging to, the harem (together with dwarfs, eunuchs, Kirātas or mountaineers, Mlechchhas or barbarians, the mock-brother-in-law of a king, i. e. the brother of his concubine, hump-backs, mutes &c.: वामनषण्डकिरातम्लेच्छाभीराः शकारकुब्जाद्याः). The same work, in defining the purposes for which Sanskṛt and the Prākṛt-dialects are used in the dramatic dialogue, appropriates the dialect of the Abhīras (which therefore is not considered by the <i>Sāh.</i> as an Apabhranśa-dialect) to cowherds and woodcutters; comp. आभीरी s. v. आभीर; (आभीरेषु तथाभीरी…। आभीरी शावरी चापि काष्ठ- पत्त्रोपजीविषु); others hold the Abhīra-dialect as belonging to the Apabhranśa, when it would be excluded from dramatic use. See अपभ्रंश and <i>Lassen'</i>s <i>Institutiones Linguae</i> <i>Pracriticae.</i>--(The word occurs usually in the form आभीर; the dialect spoken by the Abhīras is <i>always</i> called आभीरी, not अभीरी.) <div n='P'>2. n. (? -रम्) The name of a <i>Mātrāvṛtta</i> or Prākṛt metre, regulated by quantity; it consists of a stanza of four lines with eleven <i>mātrās</i> in each line (the value of a mātrā being a short syllable, and a long syllable equal to two short), viz. each line being composed either of seven mātrās and a Scolius (˘¯˘), or of a Dactylus (¯˘˘), a Iambus (˘¯) and a Scolius, or of a Scolius, a Tribrachys (˘˘˘) and a Scolius. E. ईर् with अभि, kṛt aff. अच् (according to several comm. of the <i>Amarak.</i>); but the word is probably not of Sanskṛ4tic origin."
