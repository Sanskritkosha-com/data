In No, 21, Ayodhyā is described as a victorious camp. full of great ships, and elephants and horses. In No. 39 certain brāhmaṇas belonging to Ayodhyā, living in the vicinity of Mahādeva Śaileśvara are named and are mentioned as belonging to various gotras and caraṇas, and as proficient in observants, in sacred duty, in the mantras, the sūtras, bhāṣyas and pravacanas.<sup>356</sup> <div n='P'/>It has been venerated as one of the most important and holy places of the Hindus.<sup>357</sup> Vinītā was another name for this city.<sup>358</sup> Its other names including Viṇīā (Vinītā) are mentioned in the Vividhatīrthakalpa.<sup>359</sup> Fa-Hsien calls it Sha-che and Ptolemy knew it as Sogeda.<sup>360</sup> Ayodhyā and Sāketa have been treated by many writers as being identical. Csoma de kōrös<sup>361</sup> calls this place as “Sāketan or Ayodhyā” and H.H. Wilson in his dictionary, refers to Sāketa as ‘the city of Ayodhyā’. Several passages in the Raghuvaṃśa<sup>362</sup> confirm it. The Vividhatīrthakalpa mentions Sākeyam (Sāketa) as a synonym for Ayodhyā,<sup>363</sup> but in the Buddhist literature we find separate references to Ayodhyā and Sāketa which creates doubt about their identity and suggests that the two existed separately.<sup>364</sup> V. Pathak quotes a well known verse occurring in the Yuga Purāṇa, a section of Gārgī Saṃhitā,<sup>365</sup> to show that Sāketa is the same as Ayodhyā. But there is nothing in the passage to support the view. <div n='P'/>The ancient city of Ayodhyā or Sāketa is described in the Rāmāyaṇa as situated on the banks of the Sarayū or Sarjū river.<sup>366</sup> During the Buddhist period, Ayodhyā was divided into Uttara (Northern) Kosala and Dakṣiṇa (Southern) Kosala. The river Sarayū was the dividing line between the two provinces. Ayodhyā was the capital of the latter.<sup>367</sup> Ancient tradition believes it to have been built by Manu.<sup>368</sup> <div n='P'/>The history of Kośala, with its mighty King Prasenajit and his son Vidudabha pales into insignificance with the emergence of the Magadhan rulers as powerful antagonists. The Nandas, followed by the Mauryas, assimilated Kośala in their empire. Under the Śuṅgas, it was being ruled by a viceroy. An inscription from Ayodhyā mentions Puṣyamitra as having performed two horse-sacrifices. Under the Kuṣāṇas, the city remained more or less in oblivion. Subsequently in the Purāṇas it figures along with Prayāga and Magadha as forming part of the kingdom of the Guptas. The spurious Gayā Plate of Samudragupta (No. 21) mentions it as a seat of a Gupta camp of victory. The history of the city in the postGupta period is wrapped up in obscurity. It was within the empire of the Pratihāras and Gāhaḍavālas of Kanauj. Ayodhyā is described by Muslim historians<sup>369</sup> to have been a wilderness. <div n='P'/>The Slaves and Khilji rulers held sway over it, and subsequently it received importance as the headquarters of Oudh. It was under the charge of Muslim governors appointed from Delhi, but with the emergence of Jaunpur as a strong kingdom Ayodhyā was completely over-shadowed. It was a mint-town in the time of Akbar, but there is no reference to it in later Chronicles.<sup>370</sup> <div n='P'/>Ayodhyā is important as a centre of pilgrimage. There are several places in the city connected with different events in the life of Rāma. Rāma was born at a place called Janmasthāna. At Chīrodaka also called Chīrasāgara, Daśaratha performed, with the help of Ṛṣyaśṛṅga Ṛṣi, the sacrifices for obtaining a son. At a place called Tretā-kā-Ṭhākur, Rāmacandra performed the horse sacrifice by setting up the image of Sītā. At Ratnamaṇḍapa, he held his Council,<sup>371</sup> at Swargadwāram in Fyzabad, his body was burnt. At Lakṣmaṇa-kuṇḍa, Lakṣmaṇa disappeared in the river Sarayū. Daśaratha accidentally killed Śravaṇa, the blind Ṛṣi's son, at Majhaurā in the district of Fyzabad.<sup>372</sup> Ayodhyā engaged the attention of the Muslim rulers some of whom set up mosques here, of these the mosques of Babar and and Aurangzeb are notable.<sup>373</sup> At present this city forms a part of the district of Fyzabad."
