There the great ascetic <i>Trita</i> had lived and drunk <i>soma</i> in a pit, where his two brothers had left him, and therefore were cursed by him. Requested by <i>Janamejaya</i> <i>Vaiśampāyana</i> related: In a former <i>yuga</i> there were three brothers who were ascetics: <i>Ekata, Dvita</i>, and <i>Trita</i>, like to <i>Prajāpati</i>, having by their tapas won <i>Brahmaloka (Brahma-</i> <i>lokajitaḥ</i>), and being blessed with children. At last their father <i>Gautama</i> died, having passed a long life here. Those kings who had been his <i>yajamānas</i> continued to pay respect to his sons. Once, thinking of performing a sacrifice and having received animals from their <i>yajamānas</i>, those <i>maharṣis</i> came towards the east. <i>Trita</i> was walking in front, <i>Ekata</i> and <i>Dvita</i> in his rear, bringing up the animals. <i>Ekata</i> and <i>Dvita</i> thought of taking the kine away and deserting <i>Trita</i>. In the night they saw a wolf. <i>Trita</i> ran in fright and fell into a deep pit on the bank of the <i>Sarasvatī</i>. Though hearing his wails of woe, his brothers deserted him. <i>Trita</i> feared to die because he had not earned the merit of drinking <i>soma</i>, and in imagination performed a sacrifice, himself being the <i>hotṛ</i> and uttering the <i>ṛces, yajuṣes</i>, and <i>sāmans</i> (description). <i>Bṛhaspati</i> prevailed upon the gods to go there lest <i>Trita</i> should become angry and create other gods. <i>Trita</i> duly gave them their shares with proper <i>mantras</i>; they granted him boons; that the gods should deliver him [from the well], and that he who bathes in that well shall have the end which is attained by persons who have drunk <i>soma</i>. At these words the <i>Sarasvatī</i>, with her waves, appeared within that well. Raised aloft by her, <i>Trita</i> emerged and worshipped the gods. Meeting his brothers he cursed them, saying that they should become wolves and have for offspring leopards and bears and apes (IX, <b>36</b>): IX, <b>35</b>, 2062 (on the Sarasvatī); <b>36</b>, 2064, 2068, 2093(?).—§ 615 (Baladevatīrthayātrā): IX, <b>36</b>, 2118."
