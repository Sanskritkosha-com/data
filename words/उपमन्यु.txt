I was born as his son and <i>Dhaumya</i> as my younger brother. Accompanied by <i>Dhaumya</i>, I once came to the hermitage of certain ṛṣis. There I saw milk, which appeared to me to be like to <i>amṛta</i>. Coming home, I asked my mother to give me some food prepared with milk. Having no milk my mother was sorry. She then took a cake (of rice) and boiled it into water and placed it before me, saying that it was milk. Knowing the nature of milk, I understood that this was not milk; this I said to my mother, who then answered me that ascetics in the wood could not have milk. “Whence shall we, who live at the river, the resort of the <i>Vālakhilyas</i>, obtain milk? In the wilderness are no offspring of <i>Surabhī</i>.” Then she told me to devote myself to <i>Śaṅkara</i> (i.e. Śiva). Questioned by me about Śiva my mother then, in accordance with the discourses of the <i>munis</i>, described the diverse forms of <i>Mahādeva</i> (i.e. Śiva) (η). I then applied myself to the practice of penances in order to gratify <i>Śiva</i>. After a thousand celestial years <i>Mahādeva</i> appeared to me in the form of <i>Śakra</i> (i.e. Indra) riding on his elephant, but I did not desire a boon from any other deity than <i>Mahādeva</i>. Questioned by Indra about the reason, I stated <i>Śiva</i> to be the existent and the non-existent, the manifest and the unmanifest, the eternal and immutable, etc., and that there was nothing superior to <i>Śiva</i> (θ). <i>Mahādeva</i> resides in the worlds named <i>Bhū</i>, etc. (ι). In all the encounters of the gods, etc. (κ), <i>Bhava</i> restores power to those who meet with destruction. It is <i>Maheśvara</i> who made futile the boons given to <i>Andhaka</i>, etc. (λ). He is adored by <i>yogins</i>, etc. (μ). <i>Brahmán</i>, etc. (ν), always say that there is none higher than <i>Mahādeva</i>. His sign (<i>liṅga</i>) is worshipped by <i>Brahmán</i>, etc. The creatures bear only the signs of <i>Mahādeva</i> and his spouse, and those of <i>Brahmán</i>, etc. (ο). “I shall never acknowledge any other deity. Nor would I take the fulfilment of all my wishes from any other deity.” When I had finished this-speech, the celestial elephant became transformed into a white bull (description), on the back of which <i>Mahādeva</i>, with <i>Umā</i>, was seated (description of Śiva and his weapons: <i>Pināka</i> (π)). The <i>Pāśupata</i> weapon is superior to all other weapons such as the <i>Brāhma</i>, etc. (ρ), but the <i>śūla</i> (σ) is even superior. <i>Śiva</i> was also armed with the battle-axe, which he had given to <i>Rāma Jāmadagnya</i> (τ). He was surrounded by <i>Brahmán</i>, etc. (υ). The deities praised Śiva by uttering diverse hymns (ϕ). “I then praised him with a hymn (χ) and offered him <i>arghya</i> (water). <i>Śiva</i> became gratified and granted me the fulfilment of all my wishes. I once more praised him (ψ) and asked that I and my kinsmen and friends might always eat food with milk. <i>Śiva</i> granted this, and that after the expiration of a <i>kalpa</i> I should obtain the companionship of <i>Śiva</i>. Then the god disappeared”: XIII, <b>14</b>, (784), (880), 928, 932.—§ 730 (do.): XIII, <b>14</b>, (964); <b>15</b>, 1034, (1036); <b>16</b>, (1037), (1104), (1109); <b>17</b>, (1115); <b>18</b>, 1358 (<i>U</i>. taught <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> certain mantras by which he succeeded in seeing <i>Śiva, U</i>. afterwards recited to <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> the 1000 names of <i>Śiva</i>, which had been communicated to him by <i>Taṇḍi</i>)."
