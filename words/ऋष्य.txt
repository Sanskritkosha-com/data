He was brought up in the forest by his father, and he saw no other human being till he nearly reached his manhood. When a great drought well nigh devastated the country of Aṅga, its king Lomapāda, at the advice of Brāhmaṇas, caused Ṛṣyaśṛṅga to be brought to him by means of a number of damsels, and gave his daughter Śāntā (adopted by him, her real father being Daśaratha) in marriage to him, who being greatly pleased caused <lbinfo n='copi+ous'/> copious showers of rain to fall in his <lbinfo n='king+dom'/> kingdom. It was this sage that <lbinfo n='perfor+med'/> performed for king Daśaratha the sacrifice which brought about the birth of Rāma and his three brothers]."
