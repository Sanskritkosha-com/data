            "content": "<b>Ṛṣyaśṛṅga</b>¦ (B. <i>Ṛśya°</i>), a muni, son of Vibhāṇḍaka. § 11 (Parvasaṅgr.): I, <b>2</b>, 443 (<i>°sya caritraṃ</i>, cf. § 391).—§ 270 (Brahmasabhāv.): II, <b>11</b>, 440 (in the palace of Brahmán).— § 390<i>d</i> (Tīrthayātrāp.): <i>Ṛ.</i>, the son of <i>Kāśyapa</i> (i.e. Vibhāṇḍaka) born by a hind, caused <i>Indra</i> to rain during a drought in the territory of Lomapāda, who gave him his daughter Śāntā: III, <b>110</b>, 9991.—§ 391 (do.): III, <b>110</b>, 9994.—§ 391 (cf. do.). The <i>viprarṣi Vibhāṇḍaka Kāśyapa</i> practising austerities near a great lake saw the <i>Apsaras Urvaśī</i>, whence his semen fell into the water and was lapped up by a hind, that was drinking. That hind was a daughter of the gods (<i>deva-</i> <i>kanyā</i>). Brahmán had transformed her into a hind, and when she had given birth to a <i>muni</i> she would be freed. She now gave birth to a son, who was named <i>Ṛṣyaśṛṅga</i>, because there was a horn on his head. He passed his days in the forest, devoted to brahmacarya, and he had never seen any human being except his father. At that time the king of the <i>Aṅgas</i>, <i>Lomāpāda</i>, a friend of <i>Daśaratha</i>, had been shunned by the brahmans and was without a <i>purohita</i>, because he had been guilty of falsehood towards a brahman and therefore <i>Indra</i> did not give rain in his territory. At the advice of a wise brahman he did atonement for his sins and appeased the brahmans. Thereafter he assembled his ministers in order to discuss means for bringing <i>Ṛ</i>. to his land. According to their counsel a courtezan with a number of women, etc., was sent to <i>Ṛ</i>. (III, <b>110</b>). She had constructed a floating hermitage which she moored at a short distance from <i>Vibhāṇ-</i> <i>ḍaka's</i> hermitage, and then sent her daughter, a courtezan, to Ṛṣyaśṛṅga. She refused the fruits, foot-washing, etc., saying that her religious vows consisted in not receiving such things, but implied that she might embrace him. By giving him unsuitable food, garlands, beautiful garments, and drinks, and by playing and clasping him in her arms, she made him overpowered with love, and as she went away under the pretext of performing the <i>agnihotra</i>, he became sad. When Vibhāṇḍaka (<i>b</i>) returned he wondered that <i>Ṛ</i>. was not splitting the logs for fuel, etc., and asked who had been there (III, <b>111</b>). <i>Ṛ</i>. said that a religious student (<i>brahmacārin</i>) had come to him; he had a mass of hair (<i>jaṭilaḥ</i>) and a pair of ornaments upon his wrist like his rosary (<i>akṣamālā</i>); his matted hair (<i>jaṭāḥ</i>) was neatly tied up and adhered to the forehead and was divided in two, etc. He (<i>Ṛ.</i>) wished to go to him and see him every day (III, <b>112</b>). <i>Vibhāṇḍaka</i> declared that it was a <i>Rākṣasa</i>, and in vain spent three days in searching for this one. When Vibhāṇḍaka had gone out to collect fruits the courtezans allured <i>Ṛ</i>. to enter the bark, which they unmoored, and in this way they brought him to <i>Lomapāda</i>, who prepared a beautiful forest named <i>Nāvyāśrama</i> (“Floating hermitage”) and kept <i>Ṛ</i>. in the female apartments. Suddenly rain poured down. Lomapāda gave his daughter <i>Śāntā</i> to <i>Ṛ</i>. When <i>Vibhāṇḍaka</i> was going to <i>Campā</i> in order to burn the king, the city, and his whole territory, the king let kine be placed and fields ploughed along the road, and ordered the cowherds to honour <i>Vibhāṇ-</i> <i>ḍaka</i> with hospitality when he was fatigued and hungry, and to say that all this belonged to his son and that they were his slaves. Thus <i>Vibhāṇḍaka</i> was appeased. According to the command of his father <i>Ṛ.</i>, as soon as a son had been born to him, returned to his father in the wood, and <i>Śāntā</i> followed and obeyed him, as <i>Indrasenā Nārāyaṇī</i> was ever obedient to <i>Mudgala</i>, etc. (III, <b>113</b>): III, <b>110</b>, 9999, 10000, 10006, 10007 (origin of the name), 10014, 10018, 10021, 10024 (<i>ṛṣeḥ sutaṃ</i>); III, †10034, (†10035), (†10039), †10041, †10043, †10044, †10045; <b>112</b>, (†10051); <b>113</b>, †10075 (<i>muniṃ</i>), †10076, †10080, †10091, †10093.—§ 677 (Mokṣadh.): XII, <b>235</b>, 8609 (<i>Lomapādaś ca rājarṣiḥ</i> <i>Śāntāṃ dattvā sutāṃ prabhuḥ | R°āya vipulaiḥ sarvakāmair</i> <i>ayujyata</i>, all. to § 391).—§ 702 (do.): XII, <b>297</b>δ, 10874 (<i>Kāśyapaḥ?</i> (so B., C. has <i>Ka°</i>)).—§ 767 (Ānuśāsanik.): XIII, <b>137</b>α, 6269 (= XII, 8609, with a slight variation).
