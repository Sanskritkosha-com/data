(<i>°āḥ</i>), a class of demons. § 772<i>p</i> (Pavanārjunasaṃv.): Vāyu said: When the gods with <i>Indra</i> were in the mouth of <i>Mada, Cyavana</i> took away from them the earth, and they had been deprived of the heaven by the <i>K. Brahmán</i> told the gods to seek the protection of the brahmans. The brahmans commenced a rite for the destruction of the <i>K</i>. The <i>K</i>. then sent <i>Dhanin</i>, who told the brahmans to desist, as the <i>K</i>. were equal to M.-ṛ. and very pious in all respects (enumeration). As the brahmans refused, the <i>K</i>. attacked them, but the brahmans destroyed them by creating blazing fires. The gods having slain many Dā. in battle did not know that the <i>K</i>. had been slain by the brahmans, but were informed by Nārada; then their energy increased and they obtained immortality: XIII, <b>158</b>, 7329, 7331—4, 7339, 7341—6."
