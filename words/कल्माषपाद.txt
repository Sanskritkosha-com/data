            "content": "<b>Kalmāṣapāda</b>,¦ Saudāsa (also named Mitrasaha), king of Ayodhyā and husband of Madayantī. § 188 (Madayantī): I, <b>122</b>, 4737 (being himself unable to beget children <i>K</i>. urged Madayantī to go to Vasiṣṭha, who begat Aśmaka on her, cf. § 225).—§ 224 (Vāsiṣṭha): The rājarṣi of the race of <i>Ikṣvāku Kalmāṣapāda</i> (whose sacrifices <i>Viśvāmitra</i> had desired to perform) once when hunting met the viprarṣi <i>Śaktri</i>, the eldest of Vasiṣṭha's 100 sons, and ordered him to stand out of his way, and as <i>Śaktri</i> did not yield <i>K</i>. struck him with his whip. <i>Śaktri</i> then cursed him, saying: “From this day thou shalt be a <i>rākṣasa</i>, eating human flesh.” The king began humbly to propitiate the ṛṣi, but <i>Viśvāmitra</i> (between whom and Vasiṣṭha there was a dispute about <i>K.</i>, whom they both wanted as their yājya) passed before them without being seen, and caused a <i>rākṣasa</i> named <i>Kiṅkara</i> to enter the king. <i>Viśvāmitra</i> then went away. At this time a hungry brahman beheld in the wood <i>K.</i>, who was terribly afflicted by the <i>rākṣasa</i>, and asked the king for some food with meat. <i>K</i>. asked him to stay there for a moment, and having roved for some time at pleasure at last entered his inner apartments. When waking at midnight and remembering his promise, he summoned his cook, and as the cook did not find any meat <i>K</i>. said: “Feed him with human flesh.” The cook then took human flesh from the place where the executioners were, and offered it to the hungry brahman. Seeing with his spiritual power of vision (<i>siddha-cakṣuṣā</i>) what kind of food it was, the brahman in anger said that the king himself should take a fancy to such food and wander over all the earth alarming all creatures. The curse on the king, being thus repeated a second time, became very strong, and possessed by the <i>rākṣasa</i> the king lost all his senses. A while after <i>K.</i>, beholding <i>Śaktri</i>, in order to revenge himself for the curse slew him and ate him up. And <i>Viśvāmitra</i> caused that <i>rākṣasa</i> also to devour the other sons of Vasiṣṭha: I, <b>176</b>, 6696 (<i>Ikṣvākuvaṃśajaḥ</i>), [6720 (<i>Mitrasahaḥ</i> B., C. has <i>mitrasahaṃ</i> as adj. to <i>dvijaṃ</i>)].—§ 225 (Vāsiṣṭha): I, <b>177</b>, 6761, 6768 (Vasiṣṭha delivered <i>K</i>. from the curse of Śaktri, and then at the request of <i>K</i>. begat Aśmaka on Madayantī, the queen of <i>K</i>.).—§ 228 (Aurvop.): I, <b>181</b>, 6881 (attained to heaven).—§ 229 (Vasiṣṭhop.): I, <b>182</b>, 6888, 6904 (<i>rājarṣiṃ</i>, it is related why <i>K</i>. caused Vasiṣṭha to beget a son on his wife).—[§ 480 (Pativratop., Brāhmaṇavyādhasaṃv.): III, <b>208</b>, 13817 (<i>Saudāsena</i>, all. to § 224).]— § 607 (Karṇap.): VIII, <b>45</b>, 2092 (<i>Rākṣasaḥ</i>, a sentence of his is quoted; read with B. <i>K°aḥ sarasi</i>, instead of <i>K°asarasi</i>). —[§ 638<i>b</i> (Rāmopākhyāna): XII, <b>49</b>, 1792 (<i>dāyādaḥ Saudā-</i> <i>sasya…Sarvakarmā</i>, had been protected by Parāśara).]— [§ 723 (Ānuśāsanik.): XIII, <b>6</b>α, 326 (<i>Kośalādhipaḥ…</i> <i>Saudāsaḥ</i>, had become a <i>Rākṣasa</i> through a curse, all. to § 224).]—[§ 677 (Mokṣadh.): XII, <b>235</b>, 8604 (<i>rājā</i> <i>Mitrasahaś cāpi Vasiṣṭhāya mahātmane Madayantīṃ</i> (<i>Dama°</i>, C.) <i>priyāṃ dattvā tayā saha divaṃ gataḥ</i>, cf. § 225).]—[§ 746 (do.): XIII, <b>78</b>, 3732 (<i>Ikṣvākuvaṃśajo rājā Saudāsaḥ</i>), (3734) (<i>Saudāsaḥ</i>, questioned Vasiṣṭha about kine).]— § 767 (Ānuśāsanik.): XIII, <b>137</b>α, 6262 (<i>rājā Mitrasahaḥ</i>).]— [§ 784<i>b</i> (Uttaṅka): XIV, <b>56</b>, 1654 (<i>Saudāsapatnī°</i>), 1656 (<i>Saudāsaṃ puruṣādaṃ</i>); <b>57</b>, (1672) (<i>Saudāsaḥ</i>), (1674) (do.), (1679) (do.), 1681 (<i>Saudāsa°</i>); <b>58</b>, 1690 (<i>Mitrasahaṃ</i>), (1691) (<i>Saudāsaḥ</i>), (1694) (do.), (1700) (do.), (1704) (do.)
