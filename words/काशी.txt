            "content": "5. <i>Kāśī</i>¦ (No. 28, L. 6): It is mentioned in Inscription No. 28. According to the inscription a vihāra at Vaṭa-gohālī was inhabited by the disciples of the Nigrantha preceptor (Śramaṇācārya) Guhanandin, belonging to the Pañca-stūpa section (nikāya) of Kāśī.<sup>578</sup> Evidently Vaṭagohālī was a seat of Jain monks who had their major seat at Kāśī. <div n='P'/>The name Kāśī is derived from the root Kaś ‘to shine’. The Skandapurāṇa<sup>579</sup> says that the city of Kāśī became famous by that name because it sheds light on (the way to) nirvāṇa or because, that indescribable refulgence, viz. god Śiva shines forth here.<sup>580</sup> B.C. Law connects it with Ti-miao meaning ‘read sprouts’, a Chinese translation of the word and this links it with a certain kind of grass.<sup>581</sup> It has been known for centuries under five different names, viz., Vārāṇasī (modern Banaras), Kāśī, Avimukta, Ānandakānana and Śmaśāna or Mahāśmaśāna.<sup>582</sup> <div n='P'/>The earliest mention of the Kāśīs as a tribal people occurs in the Paippalāda recension of the Atharvaveda.<sup>583</sup> Vārāṇasī was the capital of the people of Kāśī.<sup>584</sup> Thus it seems that geographically Kāśī represented a larger area than Vārāṇasī, the latter being the capital of the former. But in medieval times the position became just the reverse. Vārāṇasī comprehended the entire district and Kāśī generally represented only a small place. In a grant of Mahārāja Vināyakapāla we get a reference to a village of Tikkarikā situated in the Pratiṣṭhāna-bhukti, and attached to Kāśī-pāra-Pathaka which belonged to Vārāṇasī viṣaya.<sup>585</sup> Kāśī pāra-pathaka represented the site of the ancient city of the Kāśī.<sup>586</sup> The Vividhatīrthakalpa<sup>587</sup> also mentions Kāśī as a janapada in the Vārāṇasī City. <div n='P'/>The ancient kingdom of Kāśī was bounded by Kośala on the north, Magadha on the east, and Vatsa on the west. The Cedis and Karuṣas lived to their south.<sup>588</sup> At the time of Buddha, the kingdom of Kāśī was absorbed by the kingdom of Kośala.<sup>589</sup> <div n='P'/>We know that Lord Buddha gave his first discourse near Kāśī in the Deer Park at Sārnāth. Kāśī was an important Buddhist centre and was a seat of monastic establishments in the time of Aśoka.<sup>590</sup> During the period of Gupta rule it was on its way to become a strong centre of Śiva worship with the mahāliṅgas set up in different parts of the city.<sup>591</sup> The Purāṇas include the region in the Gupta empire.<sup>592</sup> <div n='P'/>It was a great centre of trade and commerce. Patañjali in his Mahābhāṣya<sup>593</sup> mentions Kāśī cloth. The Buddhist literature gives us many accounts of the merchants of the city.<sup>594</sup> <div n='P'/>Kāśī has been a place of much importance for Hindu pilgrimage. Its religious importance has been discussed at length in the Kāśīkhaṇḍa of the Skanda Purāṇa. Lord Śiva never leaves it, hence it is known as Avimukta. A man who dies here is believed to get emancipation.<sup>595</sup>"
