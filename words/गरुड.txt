Having been directed by Vinatā to live upon the Niṣādas (<i>b</i>) but not to injure the brahmans, and being taught by her how to know who is a brahman, he set out, and, having come to the Niṣādas, he raised a great quantity of dust, and opened his mouth; there the Niṣādas entered by thousands, being blinded by the dust, and were devoured (I, <b>28</b>). A brahman who, with his wife of the Niṣāda caste, entered the throat of <i>G.</i>, and began to burn him, was recognized and relieved with his wife by <i>G</i>. (I, <b>29</b>): I, <b>28</b>, 1320, (1327); <b>29</b>, (1343), 1344.—§ 41 (do.): As <i>G.'s</i> hunger was not appeased Kaśyapa told him of the elephant Supratīka (<i>b</i>) and the tortoise Vibhāvasu: I, <b>29</b>, (1348).—§ 42 (do.): Then Kaśyapa blessed <i>G.</i>: I, <b>29</b>, 1371.—§ 43 (do.): <i>G</i>. then seized the elephant and the tortoise and came to the tīrtha Alamba (?Nīl. and BR., “without reposing) (<i>b</i>). A banyan-tree invited him to sit on one of its huge branches, but the branch broke (I, <b>29</b>). <i>G</i>. caught the branch with his beak, and perceiving Vālakhilyas suspended therefrom with their head downwards he continued to fly with the branch, the elephant, and the tortoise, fearing to kill the Vālakhilyas if he should throw away the branch. The Vālakhilyas therefore gave him the name Garuḍa (etymology: <i>guruṃ bhāraṃ samāsādyoḍḍīnaḥ</i>, v. 1390). On Gandhamādana he saw Kaśyapa engaged in ascetic devotions. Kaśyapa propitiated the Vālakhilyas (<i>c</i>) for him, then they abandoned the bough and went to Himavat to practise ascetic penances. According to the advice of Kaśyapa <i>G</i>. flew away for a hundred thousand of yojanas to a mountain without human beings, there he threw down the bough and ate the tortoise and the elephant. Then he again rose on his wings: I, <b>29</b>, 1375; <b>30</b>, 1384, 1390, 1400, 1407, 1413.—§ 44 (do.): Omens foreboding fear began to appear among the gods. Bṛhaspati declared that it was owing to the fault of Indra and the ascetic penances of the Vālakhilyas (cf. § 45) that <i>G</i>. now approached to take away the soma. Indra then caused the gods to surround and watch the amṛta (I, <b>30</b>).— § 45 (Vālakhilya, pl.): I, <b>31</b>, 1436, 1469, 1470 (by the penances of the Vālakhilyas <i>G</i>. had been born as the lord of winged creatures (<i>patatrīṇām indraḥ</i>, v. 1455)).—§ 46 (Āstīkap.): <i>G</i>. attacked the gods, whom he blinded with dust, and Bhaumana lay as dead on the field. Indra caused Vāyu to dispel the dust. The Sādhyas and the Gandharvas fled eastwards, the Vasus and the Rudras towards the south, the Ādityas towards the west, and the Aśvins towards the north. <i>G</i>. then slew nine Yakṣas, Aśvakranda, etc. (α), who guarded the amṛta. The amṛta on all sides was surrounded with fire. <i>G</i>. then divided his mouth into 8100 mouths, and taking water from many rivers he extinguished the fire. Then he assumed a diminutive body (I, <b>32</b>), and passed through the spokes of the revolving keen-edged wheel of steel placed before the soma. Then there were two great snakes, who would reduce to ashes everyone who might be seen by them. <i>G</i>. covered their eyes with dust, and unseen by them mangled them to pieces. He then flew away with the amṛta, not drinking it himself. He met with Viṣṇu on his way and they agreed that <i>G</i>. should stay above Viṣṇu, sitting on the flagstaff of his chariot and be his vehicle, and be immortal and free from disease without drinking amṛta. While <i>G</i>. was flying Indra hurled his thunderbolt at him. <i>G</i>. did not feel the slightest pain, but in honour of Dadhīca and Indra and the thunderbolt <i>G</i>. dropped a feather, and from its beauty he gained the name Suparṇa (I, <b>33</b>). Indra and <i>G</i>. made friendship with each other, and agreed that <i>G</i>. should not give the soma to anyone for drink. Indra should bring it away after it had been put down by <i>G.</i>, and <i>G</i>. should feed on the snakes. The snakes declared Vinatā to be free; <i>G</i>. placed down the soma on some kuśa grass, and while the snakes were performing their ablutions, their daily devotions, and other religious rites, Indra took up the amṛta and reṭurned to heaven. When the snakes licked the kuśa grass their tongues were divided in twain, and the kuśa grass, from the contact with the amṛta, became sacred from this time (I, <b>34</b>): I, <b>32</b>, 1471 (<i>pakṣirāṭ</i>), 1477, 1485, 1494; <b>33</b>, 1509, 1513; <b>34</b> (1520), (1528), 1534, 1543.—§ 99 (Aṃśāvat.): I, <b>65</b>, 2548 (among the Vainateyas).—§ 120 <i>bis</i> (do.): I, <b>66</b>, 2603 (<i>Vainateyaḥ</i>, reckoned among the Ādityas).—§ 129 (do.): I, <b>66</b>, 2635 (<i>°āruṇau</i>, sons of Vinatā).—§ 191 (Arjuna): I, <b>123</b>, 4830 (present at the birth of Arjuna).—§ 244 (Rājyalābhap.): I, <b>207</b>, 7575 (<i>dvipakṣa-G°prakhyair dvāraiḥ</i>).—§ 289 (Arghāharaṇap.): II, <b>38</b>, 1395 (<i>patatāṃ mukhaṃ</i>).—[§ 277 (Jarāsandhavadhap.): II, <b>24</b>, 945, 946 (<i>Garutmān</i>, took his seat on the flagstaff of Kṛṣṇa)].—§ 512 (Ghoṣayātrāp.): III, <b>241</b>, 14897 (<i>rathair G°niḥsvanaiḥ</i>).—§ 549 (Pāṇḍavapr.): IV, <b>2</b>, 51 (<i>patatām iva</i>, sc. <i>varaḥ</i>).—§ 561 (Yānasandhip.): V, <b>71</b>, 2578 (Kṛṣṇa identified with Ariṣṭanemi, Garuḍa, Suparṇa).—§ 564 (Mātaliyop.): V, <b>101</b>, 3600 (<i>°ātmajāḥ</i>, enumeration of his descendants); <b>105</b>, 3674, (3676), 3704, 3705 (<i>G</i>. who wished to devour the serpent Sumukha was humiliated by Viṣṇu, who then threw Sumukha upon the breast or <i>G</i>.).—§ 565 (Gālavacarita): V, <b>107</b>, 3757; <b>112</b>, 3854 (the friend of Gālava, whom he assisted in his search for 1000 horses).—§ 574 (Jambūkh.): VI, <b>3</b>, 152 (<i>Vainateyaḥ</i> <i>…Suparṇaḥ</i>); [<b>6</b>, 208 (<i>Suparṇasya</i>, father of Sumukha)]. —§ 593 (Abhimanyuvadhap.): VII, <b>36</b>, 1565 (<i>pannagaiś</i> <i>chinnair G°eneva</i>); <b>37</b>, 1605 (<i>°ānilaraṃhobhiḥ…hayaiḥ</i>).— § 599 (Jayadrathavadhap.): VII, <b>109</b>, 4124 (<i>udvavarha…</i> <i>pannagaṃ G°o yathā</i>); <b>143</b>, 6000 (<i>bhava G°ottamāṅgayānaḥ</i>, says Kṛṣṇa to Bhūriśravas).—§ 600 (Ghaṭotkacavadhap.): VII, <b>174</b>υυ, 7873 (<i>°-Takṣakau</i>).—§ 603 (Nārāyaṇāstramokṣaṇap.): VII, <b>201</b>, 9416 (<i>°ānilaraṃhasaḥ</i>).—§ 605 (Karṇap.): VIII, <b>12</b>, 446 (<i>°prahitair ugrair pañcāsyair</i> <i>uragair iva</i>); <b>18</b>, 688 (<i>turagān G°ānilaraṃhasaḥ</i>).—§ 607 (Haṃsakākīyop.): VIII, <b>41</b>, 1888 (<i>°sya gatau tulyāh</i>, sc. <i>haṃsāḥ</i>).—§ 608 (Karṇap.): VIII, <b>59</b>, 2955 (<i>°syeva patato</i> <i>jighṛkṣoḥ pannagottamaṃ</i>); <b>65</b>, 3300 (<i>vājibhir G°opamaiḥ</i>); <b>77</b>, 3882 (<i>°syeva patato pannagārthe yathā purā</i>); <b>87</b>, 4468 (<i>yathā</i>); <b>90</b>, †4679 (<i>nāgaḥ svayaṃ ya āyād G°sya vaktraṃ</i>).— § 615<i>u</i> (Skanda): IX, <b>45</b>γ, 2518 (came to the investiture of Skanda), 2585 (<i>°ānanāḥ</i>, sc. the warriors of Skanda); <b>46</b>, 2669 (gave his favourite son, a peacock, to Skanda).—§ 717<i>c</i> (Uparicara): XII, <b>338</b>, 12852 (carried Uparicara up to the welkin).—[§ 730 (Ānuśāsanik.): XIII, <b>14</b>δ, 682 (the Vālakhilyas by their penances created <i>Suparṇaṃ somahartāraṃ</i>, cf. § 45)].—§ 785 (Anugītāp.): XIV, <b>88</b>, 2635 (<i>rukmapakṣo</i> <i>nicitas trikoṇo G°ākṛtiḥ</i>).
