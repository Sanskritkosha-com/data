The function of the gṛhapati-ratna is to discern the location of hidden treasures by means of the divya-cakṣus which he possesses, and bring those of them which are ownerless (asvāmika) into the possession of the king: <ls>LV</ls> 〔17.17—22〕; substantially the same statement in <lang>Pali</lang>, <ls>DN</ls> 〔ii.176.7 ff.〕 For this reason, no doubt, <ls>PTSD</ls> <ab>s.v.</ab> ratna translates gahapati by <i>treasurer</i>; but there is no clear evidence that he had precisely the functions which we should associate with that title. In <lang>Pali</lang> a gahapati (see <ls>PTSD</ls> <ab>s.v.</ab>) is, to be sure, often associated with seṭṭhi = śreṣṭhin; the <lang>Pali</lang> word is often rendered <i>treasurer</i>, but perhaps <i>capitalist</i> would be better (<ab>orig.</ab> <i>guild-leader</i>)."
