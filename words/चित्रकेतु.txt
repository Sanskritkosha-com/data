When he was brooding over this, there came the sage Angiras; getting to know his mind he performed a ritual in honour of Tvaṣṭā and the remnant of offering was given to his eldest queen, Kṛtādyutī, who brought forth a son. Though the king was glad, his wives grew jealous and poisoned the child to death. The king, queen and others ceaselessly lamented. On this Angiras and Nārada came on the scene and consoled them. Angiras addressed him on the instability of life, illustrating it by the story of Bhoja. Nārada instructed him into a <i>mantropa-</i> <i>niṣad.</i> By meditating on this for seven nights, he was told, that he would see Sankarṣana and get over the illusion relating to duality. So he had his purificatory bath at the Jamunā and was initiated into the <i>vidyā</i> by Nārada. By meditating for seven days, the king became the lord of Vidyādharas. He then praised Hari in the form of Ananta and had a <i>darśan</i> of the Lord. <div n='P'/>Once he flew in the air and saw Śiva sitting with Pārvatī on his lap in the presence of his attendants and others. He laughed at this, which enraged Pārvatī who cursed him to be born an Asura. Citraketu alighted from his aerial car and begged for pardon. After he went away, Śiva told Pārvatī that Citraketu was a devotee of Hari, and hence his devotee also. Therefore he deserved pardon. Pārvatī was appeased, and Citraketu was born as Vṛtra. <div n='P'/>Bhā. VI. Chaps. 14-17."
