[His father died, being bitten by a serpent; and Janamejaya, determined to avenge the injury, resolved to <lbinfo n='exter+minate'/> exterminate the whole serpent-race. He accordingly instituted a serpent <lbinfo n='sacri+fice'/> sacrifice, and burnt down all serpents <lbinfo n='ex+cept'/> except Takṣaka, who was saved only by the intercession of the sage Āstīka, at whose request the sacrifice was closed. It was to this king that  <lbinfo n='Vai+śampāyana'/> Vaiśampāyana related the Mahābhārata, and the king is said to have listened to it to expiate the sin of killing a Brāhmaṇa.]."
