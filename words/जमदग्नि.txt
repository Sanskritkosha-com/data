Arjuna Kārtavīrya, § 394), while <i>Gādhi</i>, the king of <i>Kānyakubja</i>, was dwelling in the wood, there was born to him a beautiful daughter, <i>Satyavatī</i>, whom <i>Ṛcīka Bhārgava</i> asked in marriage. <i>Gādhi</i> said that, according to a family custom, the bridegroom must give a dowry of 1,000 brown steeds with a single sable ear each (so PCR. translates <i>ekataḥ śyāmakarṇāṇāṃ</i>, cf. V, 3740, and Gālavacarita). <i>Ṛcīka</i> obtained them from <i>Varuṇa</i> (the spot where the horses appeared was thence named Aśvatīrtha) and married <i>Satyavatī</i> in <i>Kānyakubja</i> on the <i>Gaṅgā</i>, the very gods being companions of the bridegroom (<i>janyāḥ</i>). Then his father <i>Bhṛgu</i> came to see him and his wife, and being pleased with <i>Satyavatī</i>, granted her the boon that a son should be born to herself and to her mother, telling her that during their season they should embrace, her mother an <i>aśvattha</i> tree and herself an <i>udumbara</i> tree, and eat two pots of rice and milk (<i>caru</i>) which he had prepared, having ransacked the whole universe. Then <i>Bhṛgu</i> disappeared. They, however, made an interchange both of the pots and of the trees which they embraced. Knowing this by his divine knowledge, <i>Bhṛgu</i> came once more and told <i>Satyavatī</i> that she had been deluded by her mother, and that therefore she would give birth to a brahman of kṣatriya character (<i>kṣatravṛttiḥ</i>) and her mother to a kṣatriya of brahman character (<i>brāhmaṇācāraḥ</i>). At her repeated entreaties, however, he granted her that not her son but her grandson should be of that description. The son of <i>Satyavatī</i> was <i>J.</i>, who excelled many ṛṣis in Vedic lore (<i>Vedādhyayanena</i>), and to whom the whole Dhanurveda appeared spontaneously (<i>pratyabhāt</i>), and likewise the four kinds of weapon (<i>astrāṇi</i>): III, <b>115</b>, 10167.—§ 396: <i>J</i>. devoted himself to the study of the <i>Veda</i> and to penances. He married <i>Reṇukā</i>, the daughter of king <i>Prasenajit</i>, and lived with her in his hermitage practising austerities. She gave birth to five sons, of whom <i>Rāma</i> was the youngest. Once when <i>Reṇukā</i> had been filled with desire, seeing the <i>Mārttikāvata</i> king <i>Citraratha</i> bathing, together with his wife, <i>J</i>. ordered his sons <i>Rumaṇvat</i> the eldest), <i>Suṣeṇa, Vasu</i>, and <i>Viśvāvasu</i> to kill their mother, but as they refused to do so he cursed them, so that they lost their senses and behaved like beasts and birds. Then he ordered <i>Rāma</i> to do it, and he immediately severed her head with an axe, and then prevailed upon <i>J</i>. to grant him that <i>Reṇukā</i> might be restored to life and not remember that she had been slain, that he himself might not be affected by this sin, that his brothers might recover their former state, and that he himself might be unrivalled on the field of battle and obtain a long life: III, <b>116</b>, 10183, 10185, 10188.— § 397: Once when the sons of <i>J</i>. had gone out, <i>Arjuna</i> <i>Kārtavīrya</i>, the lord of the country near the seashore (<i>Anūpapatiḥ</i>), came to the hermitage, and, though he was praised by <i>Reṇukā</i>, he carried away the calf of the <i>homadhenu</i> and pulled down the trees. <i>J</i>. told this to <i>Rāma</i>, who then rushed towards <i>Arjuna</i> and cut down his 1,000 arms with his arrows and at last killed him. Then the sons of <i>Arjuna</i> came while <i>Rāma</i> was away, and with their arrows killed <i>J.</i>, who did not fight, but repeatedly shouted the name of <i>Rāma</i>. When they had gone away, <i>Rāma</i> returned to the hermitage: III, <b>116</b>, 10196, 10197.—§ 602 (Droṇavadhap.): VII, <b>190</b>ν, 8727.—§ 606<i>b</i> (Paraśu-Rāma): VIII, <b>34</b>, 1583 (<i>Bhārga-</i> <i>vānāṃ kule jātaḥ</i>, father of Paraśu-Rāma).—§ 638<i>b</i> (Rāmop.): XII, <b>49</b>, 1744 (<i>Bhārgavaṃ</i>, son of Ṛcīka and Satyavatī), 1746 (father of Rāma), 1761 (<i>°dhenvāḥ…vatsaṃ</i>), 1765 (slain by the sons of Arjuna Kārtavīrya; cf. §§ 395—7).— § 665 (Mokṣadh.): XII, <b>208</b>ι, 7600 (<i>Ṛcīkasya putraḥ</i>, one of the ṛṣis of the north).—§ 702 (do.): XII, <b>293</b>α, 10762 (had praised Viṣṇu).—§ 721<i>b</i> (Viśvāmitrop.): XIII, <b>4</b>, 245 (his birth; cf. § 395).—§ 733 (Rāmahrada): XIII, <b>25</b>, 1734 (<i>°gatiṃ labhet</i>, sc. by bathing in Mahāhrada).—§ 745<i>c</i> (Cyavana-Kuśikasaṃv.): XIII, <b>55</b>, 2912 (<i>Bhṛguśārdūlaḥ</i>, Ṛcīka will beget <i>J.</i>, who will master the Dhanurveda).— § 750<i>b</i> (Bisastainyop.): XIII, <b>93</b>α, 4416, (4444), (4464), (4495) (etymology of his name), (4521).—§ 751<i>b</i> (Śapathavidhi): XIII, <b>94</b>α, †4550, (4571).—§ 752<i>b</i> (Chattropānahotpatti): XIII, <b>95</b>, 4606 (<i>°eś ca saṃvādaṃ Sūryasya ca</i>), (4618); <b>96</b>, 4629, 4630, (4633), 4636 (terrifies the Sun (Sūrya), who in order to pacify him gives him an umbrella and a pair of sandals).—§ 759 (Ānuśāsanik.): XIII, <b>106</b>δ, 5200 (among the ṛṣis who have attained to heaven through observance of fasts).—§ 766 (do.): XIII, <b>127</b>, (6073).— § 770 (do.): XIII, <b>151</b>ι, 7117 (<i>Ṛcīkatanayaḥ</i>, one of the gurus of Dhaneśvara in the north).—§ 775 (do.): XIII, <b>166</b>ζ, 7670 (<i>Ṛcīkaputraḥ</i>, one of the ṛṣis of the north).— § 782<i>c</i> (Arjuna Kārtavīrya): XIV, <b>29</b>, 823 (father of Rāma). —§ 786<i>f</i> (Nakulākhyāna): In former times <i>J</i>. purposed to perform a <i>śrāddha</i>; his <i>homa</i>-cow came to him, and he milked her himself.

Through the curse of the <i>Pitṛs, Krodha</i> became a mungoose until he had spoken disrespectfully of <i>Dharma</i>. Then he wandered about to sacrifices and other sacred places, employed in censuring great sacrifices, until he came and censured the horse-sacrifice of <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, who was <i>Dharma's</i> self; then he became freed from his curse: XIV, <b>92</b>, 2887, (2894).
