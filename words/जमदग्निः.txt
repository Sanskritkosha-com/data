He was a pious sage, deeply engaged in study, and is said to have <lbinfo n='obtain+ed'/> obtained entire possession of the Vedas. His wife was Reṇukā who bore him five sons. One day when she had gone out to bathe, she beheld a loving pair of Gandharvas (according to some Citraratha and his queen) sporting and playing in the water. The lovely sight made her feel envious of their pleasure, and she <lbinfo n='return+ed'/> returned defiled by unworthy thoughts, <lbinfo n='‘wet+ted'/> ‘wetted but not purified by the stream’. Her husband, who was anger incarnate, <lbinfo n='see+ing'/> seeing her shorn of the lustre of her <lbinfo n='sanc+tity'/> sanctity, furiously scolded her, and ordered his sons, as they came in, to cut off her head. But the first four sons shrank from that cruel deed. It was only <lbinfo n='Para+śurāma'/> Paraśurāma, the youngest, that with <lbinfo n='charac+teristic'/> characteristic obedience to his father's <lbinfo n='com+mand'/> command, struck off her head with his axe. The deed pacified the father's anger, and he desired Paraśurāma to ask a boon. The kind-hearted son begged that his mother might be restored to life which the father readily granted]."
