The circumference of a fruit of that tree measures 2,500 cubits; when ripe the fruit bursts, and pours out a silvery juice which becomes a river, which passes round <i>Meru</i> and comes to the northern <i>Kurus</i>; the drinking of that juice conduces to peace of mind, no thirst is felt ever after, nor decrepitude. On that spot there is found a species of gold, called <i>jāmbūnada</i>, used for celestial ornaments and like the complexion of <i>indragopaka</i> (cochineal) insects. The men who live there are of the complexion of the morning sun: VI, <b>7</b>, 273 (<i>°-vṛkṣaḥ</i>).—§ 757<i>e</i> (Meru): XIII, <b>102</b>, †4862."
