Āstīkap.): Sauti said: The ascetic <i>J.</i>, when going about and practising religious austerities, one day saw his ancestors, the Yāyāvaras, hanging, heads down, in a great hole by a rope of <i>vīraṇa</i> fibres, which was eaten into on all sides by a rat; he was told that it was because he had no offspring. He then promised to marry, if he might get a wife of the same name as his own, and who would be given to him in charity (I, <b>13</b>). At last he married Jaratkāru, the sister of Vāsuki, the king of serpents (I, <b>14</b>), who intended by this marriage to neutralize the curse inflicted on the serpents by their mother (Kadrū, q.v.). Having begotten Āstīka, <i>J</i>. ascended to heaven together with his ancestors (I, <b>15</b>): I, <b>13</b>, 1029 (<i>Yāyāvarāṇāṃ pravaraḥ</i>), 1034, 1037, (1041), 1041, 1045; <b>14</b>, 1054, 1055, 1056; <b>15</b>, 1067, 1068. —§ 49 (Vāsuki): I, <b>38</b>, 1633, 1634, 1635 (it had been destined by Brahmán that <i>J</i>. should marry Vāsuki's sister Jaratkāru and beget Āstīka on her); <b>39</b>, 1650, 1653, 1654. —§ 50 (cf.

Āstīkap.): The story of <i>J</i>. repeated (cf. § 26) and somewhat enlarged: I, <b>45</b>, 1813, 1831 (<i>Veda-Vedāṅgapāragaḥ</i>), 1839, 1843; <b>46</b>, 1846, (1847), 1848, (1850), 1864; <b>47</b>, 1869 (<i>ṛṣiṃ</i>), 1872, 1875.—§ 54 (cf. Āstīkap.): One day. <i>J.</i>, sleeping on the lap of his wife when the sun was setting, was awakened by her, lest the twilight should pass away without his prayers being said. <i>J</i>. felt insulted, as he believed that the sun had no power to set in the usual time if he was asleep. He therefore left her and again began to practise austerities: I, <b>47</b>, 1882, 1891, 1897, 1901, 1911.—§ 60 (Sarpasattra): I, <b>53</b>, 2064; <b>54</b>, 2079.—§ 68 (Āstīka): I, <b>58</b>, 2189 (<i>yo J°uṇā jātaḥ Jarat-</i> <i>kārau</i>, i.e. Āstīka).—§ 565 (Gālavacarita): V, <b>117</b>, 3975 (<i>reme…yathā…J°ur Jaratkārvāṃ</i>)."
