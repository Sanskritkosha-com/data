            "content": "<i>Jarāsandha</i> (I)¦ — born to Bṛhadratha in two parts and cast away by the mother. Jarā (s.v.) joined them together, saying in sport ‘Live, Live’. It was Jarāsandha. He was father of Sahadeva.<sup>1</sup> King of Magadha and father-in-law of Kamśā who married his daughters Asti and Prāpti; acted as Kamśā's guru in his wicked plans. Heard of Kamśā's death from his widowed daughters and resolved to destroy all the Yādavas. He besieged Mathurā with twenty-three <i>akṣau-</i> <i>hinis,</i> stationing at the four gates king of Kalinga and others. Drums were sounded as a call to arms. Told Kṛṣṇa that he was a boy unfit to fight him and asked Rāma to meet him in battle. Rāma challenged him on the western gate. Finding all his army followers killed, Jarāsandha attacked Rāma. When the latter was about to bind him with ropes, Kṛṣṇa asked that he be set free. Jarāsandha went home greatly distressed. Three months after, Jarāsandha collected another huge army of twenty-three <i>akṣauhinis,</i> encamped at Yamunā banks and slept that night. Kṛṣṇa divided his army into three divisions and attacked the enemy on all sides by surprise. All Jarāsandha's followers took to flight leaving all their belongings which were presented to Ugrasena. <div n='P'/>Then he called on Bāṇa at his city Śoṇitapura soliciting his help against the Yadus. Bāṇa's welcome and offer to help; with this force he again besieged Mathurā. Fight between him and Rāma. Defeat of Kumbhāṇḍa and retreat of Kūpakarṇa and other soldiers of Bāṇa to their city. Jarāsandha's return to the city.<sup>2</sup> <div n='P'/>Felt angry at Śṛgāla's end and led another expedition to Mathurā. Defeat and return. In this way he led seventeen expeditions. During the eighteenth expedition a certain Yavana sent by Nārada besieged the city.<sup>3</sup> Jarāsandha attacked the Yadus going to Dvārakā after vanquishing the <i>mlecchas</i> by the formation of <i>Makaravyūha</i> when Kṛṣṇa destroyed it by throwing a big tree on it. Rāma also gave them mighty blows. Then he turned upon two brothers who were unarmed and who ran to Pravarṣaṇa hill. Jarāsandha followed them and burnt the hill by besieging it from all sides. The brothers leaped into the plains and regained Dvārakā, but were taken by their enemies to be burnt dead. His defeat at Kṛṣṇa's hands during the <i>svayamvara</i> of Rukmiṇī is mentioned. Arrival at Kuṇḍina; went to Śiśupāla and comforted him that all was due to fate, and returned to his city.<sup>4</sup> His defeats were recalled by Kṛtavarman.<sup>5</sup> He had his capital at Girivraja, where thousands of kings were kept imprisoned.<sup>6</sup> A preliminary to Yudhiṣṭhīra's <i>rājasūya</i> was to kill Jarāsandha. Finding him unconquered and also devoted to Brahmaṇas, Kṛṣṇa, Bhīma and Arjuna went to him in Brahmana's guise and asked for meals. Jarāsandha understood them to be Kṣatriyas and still recalled Bali giving the earth to Hari in a Brahmana's guise. So he offered to give his head. Then Kṛṣṇa and his two friends revealed themselves and invited him to battle. He refused to fight a coward who left Mathurā for a sea-girt-city, nor with unequal Arjuna. But he agreed to fight with Bhīma. Then battle continued for 27 days and Bhīma felt despondent. Kṛṣṇa gave him a hint by tearing a twig behind. So Bhīma pulled him down and tore him to two pieces from head to foot.<sup>7</sup> One of those who failed to hit the fish in the <i>svayam-</i> <i>vara</i> of Lakṣmaṇā.<sup>8</sup> <F>1) Bhā.
