In days of old, when the <i>Vedas</i> had been lost, the ṛṣi <i>Sārasvata</i> of <i>Aṅgiras'</i> race seated at ease on the upper garments of the <i>ṛṣis</i> in the forest of <i>T</i>. made the <i>ṛṣis</i> recollect all that they had learned before, only by distinctly pronouncing the syllable <i>om</i>. There the <i>ṛṣis</i> and the gods, <i>Varuṇa, Agni</i>, <i>Prajāpati, Hari Nārāyaṇa, Mahādeva</i>, and <i>Pitāmaha</i>, appointed <i>Bhṛgu</i> to officiate at a sacrifice, and <i>Bhṛgu</i> once more performed the <i>agnyādhāna</i> for all these ṛṣis, gratifying <i>Agni</i> with a portion of clarified butter according to the ordinance. A visit here destroys all sins, and dwelling there for a month with subdued senses, etc., leads to the <i>Brahmaloka</i> and delivers one's race: III, <b>85</b>, 8195 (<i>araṇyaṃ</i>)."
