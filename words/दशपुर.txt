            "content": "(3) <i>Daśapura</i>¦ (No. 17, L. 4, L. 16): In this inscription L. 4 refers to the migration of a guild of silkweavers from Lāṭa viṣaya (Central and Southern Gujarat) to the city of Daśapura. The guild came to this city attracted by the virtues of its kings.<sup>234</sup> The inscription refers itself to the reign of king Kumāragupta, under whom Bandhuvarman, the son of Viśvavarman<sup>235</sup> was the governor at Daśapura. L. 16 of the inscription records that it was under the governorship of Bandhuvarman (in Mālava era 493 = A.D. 437)<sup>236</sup>, that a lofty temple of the Sun-god was caused to be built by the guild of silk-cloth weavers at Daśapura.<sup>237</sup> Afterwards, under other kings, part of this temple fell into disrepair. And then it was restored by the same guild in the year 529 of the Mālava era (= A.D. 473).<sup>238</sup> <div n='P'/>Daśapura has been identified with Mandasor in Western Malwa<sup>239</sup> formerly in the Gwalior State. The ancient Daśapura stood on the north or left bank of the Siwana, a tributary of the river Śiprā.<sup>240</sup> We also find it mentioned in the Mandasor Fragmentary Inscription of the time of Ādityavardhana (A.D. 490-500).<sup>241</sup> Under the Imperial Guptas the use of the Mālava or the Kṛta era seems to have been confined to Daśapura.<sup>242</sup> Thus Daśapura may have been the main city of the Western Mālavas. We also get a reference to Daśapura in the Bṛhatsaṃhitā<sup>243</sup> and the Meghadūta<sup>244</sup> of Kālidāsa. <div n='P'/>The ancient Sanskrit name Daśapura also occurs in an early Nasik inscription of Uṣavadāta,<sup>245</sup> and in one inscription of Vikram Saṃvat 1321 (= A.D. 1264) from Mandasor itself.<sup>246</sup> <div n='P'/>There are two explanations of the name Daśapura or Dasor. The local explanation is that the place was originally a city of the Puranic king Daśaratha. But, on this view, the name of the city should have been Daśarathapura or Dasrathore. Fleet points out that even now, the township includes some twelve to fifteen outlying hamlets or divisions (Khilcipur, Jankūpurā, Rāmpuriyā, Candrapurā, Bālagañja, etc.) and that ‘when it was originally constituted, it included exactly ten (daśa) such hamlets (pura)’.<sup>247</sup> This view of Fleet is more appealing. <div n='P'/>Mandasor, the full form of the name of the town by which it is officially known and which is entered in maps, is also explained in two ways: <div n='P'/>As suggested by Bhagwan Lal Indraji, it may represent Manda-Daśapura, “the distressed or afflicted Daśapura,” referring to the overthrow of the town, and the destruction of the Hindu temples in it, by the Musalmans, in memory of which, even to the present day, the Nāgar brāhmaṇas of the area do not drink water there. This is supported by the fact that some paṇḍits still call it Mannadasor.<sup>248</sup> <div n='P'/>F.S. Growse suggests that the name combines the two names of Mad and Daśapura: the former<sup>249</sup> being the name of a village (also called Afzalpur) about eleven miles south-east of Mandasor, from which, it is said, were brought, from ruined Hindu temples, the stones that were used in the construction of the Musalman fort at Mandasor.<sup>250</sup> <div n='P'/>It is very difficult to choose between the two explanations, but the second seems to be more reasonable."
