[He is described by <lbinfo n='Kā+lidāsa'/> Kālidāsa as a grand ideal of what a king should be. His wife was Sudakṣiṇā, a woman in every respect worthy of her husband; but they had no issue. For this he went to his family priest <lbinfo n='Va+sishṭha'/> Vasishṭha who told him and his wife to serve the celestial cow Nandinī. They accordingly served her for 21 days and were on the 22nd day favoured by the cow. A glorious boy was then born who conquered the whole world and became the founder of the line of the Raghus.]"
