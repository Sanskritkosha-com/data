He becomes enraged with everyone even at the slightest transgression; he that would give me shelter should not anger me.” As no one took notice of him (read with B. <i>°n nādriyate</i>), I invited him. Sometimes he would eat food sufficient for many thousand persons, sometimes very little, and [sometimes] he would not return home; he would laugh and weep without any visible reason; no one at that time was equal to him in years; [one day] he burnt all the beds and coverlets and all the well-adorned damsels, and then went out; then he asked for rice-milk (<i>pāyasa</i>); having previously caused every kind of food and drink to be kept ready, I caused hot rice-milk to be brought; having eaten some, he ordered me to smear my limbs with the remnant, which I did; then he smeared <i>Rukmiṇī</i>, and causing her to be yoked to a chariot, he, ascending that chariot, set out of my house, striking her with the hook, and proceeded along the high road; the <i>Dāśarhas</i> became angry; as <i>Rukmiṇī</i> tottered, he struck her [with the whip]; then he leapt down from the chariot and fled towards the south on foot, followed by us. Then he became gratified because I had subdued my anger, and said: “As long as gods and men will continue to entertain a liking for food, so long will everyone among them cherish the same liking for thee; so long as there will be righteous [men] (<i>puṇyāḥ</i>) in the worlds, so long will thy fame last; agreeable thou shalt be to all persons; whatever articles of thine have been broken or burnt or destroyed, thou shalt see restored or even better; thou wilt have no fear of death through such parts of thy body as have been smeared [with the rice-milk]; thou ought to have smeared also the soles of thy feet.” I saw my body endued with great beauty and splendour. He also blessed <i>Rukmiṇī</i>, saying: “Thou shalt be the foremost of women in fame, etc., free from decrepitude or diseases or loss of complexion, possessed of a fragrant odour, the foremost of <i>Kṛṣṇa's</i> 60,000 wives, and [after death] thou shalt dwell in the same world as <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>.” Having recommended me to be always thus disposed towards the brahmans, he disappeared. I and <i>Rukmiṇī</i> took the vow of always satisfying the brahmans. Having entered our house, I saw that everything which <i>D</i>. had broken or burnt had become renewed. From that day forth I have always worshipped the brahmans: XIII, <b>160</b>, 7416, 7449.—§ 773 (Ānuśāsanik): XIII, <b>161</b>, 7458 (<i>°aḥ</i> <i>prasādāt</i>).—§ 773<i>d</i> (Śiva): XIII, <b>161</b>, 7494 (is a form of Śiva).—§ 789 (Putradarśanap.): XV, <b>30</b>, 820 (repetition from § 131).—§ 793 (Mausalap.): XVI, <b>4</b>, †123 (had made Kṛṣṇa invulnerable except on the soles of the feet, cf. § 773<i>c</i>). Cf. Atreya (XVI, †124)."
