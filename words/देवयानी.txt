On this she cursed the youth, who in return cursed her that she should become the wife of a Kṣatriya; (see कच). Once upon a time Devayānī and her companion Śarmiṣṭhā--the daughter of <lbinfo n='Vṛsha+parvan'/> Vṛshaparvan, the king of the Daityas, went to bathe keeping their clothes on the shore. But the god Wind <lbinfo n='chang+ed'/> changed their clothes, and when they were dressed they began to quarrel about the change until Śarmiṣṭhā so far lost her temper that she slapped <lbinfo n='Devayā+nī'/> Devayānī's face, and threw her into a well. There she remained until she was seen and rescued by Yayāti, who, with the consent of her father, married her, and Śarmiṣṭhā became her servant as a recompense for her insulting conduct towards her. Devayānī lived happily with Yayāti for some years and bore him two sons, Yadu and Turvasu. Subsequently her husband became <lbinfo n='ena+moured'/> enamoured of Śarmiṣṭhā, and Devayānī, feeling herself aggrieved, abruptly left her husband and went home to her father, who at her request condemned Yayāti with the infirmity of old age; see Yayāti also]."

In a wood like <i>Caitraratha, Indra</i> transformed himself into wind and mixed up the clothes of some bathing maidens. A quarrel about the clothes resulted in <i>D.'s</i> being thrown into a well by <i>Śarmiṣṭhā</i>, the daughter of <i>Vṛṣaparvan. Yayāti</i> found her and drew her up by her right hand, and then returned to his capital. <i>Devayānī</i> sent <i>Ghūrṇikā</i> to inform <i>Śukra</i> of what had passed (I, <b>78—79</b>). <i>Śukra</i> threatened <i>Vṛṣa-</i> <i>parvan</i> that he would leave the Asuras, until <i>Śarmiṣṭhā</i>, together with 1,000 maidens, was given to <i>D</i>. (I, <b>80</b>). Surrounded by <i>Śarmiṣṭhā</i> and 2,000 maidens, <i>Devayānī</i> one day again met <i>Yayāti</i>, who at her request received her in marriage from <i>Śukra</i>, and promised that he would never invite <i>Śarmiṣṭhā</i> to share his bed (I, <b>81</b>): I, <b>78</b>, 3284, 3285, (3285), 3290, (3297), 3302, (3303), 3307, (3309), 3314; <b>79</b>, 3319, 3321, (3326); <b>80</b>, 3341, 3343, 3344, (3345), 3346, (3347), 3348, 3350, 3351, (3354), 3356, (3357); <b>81</b>, 3359, 3363, 3364, (3367), (3370), (3373), (3375), 3376, (3377), (3379), (3382), (3385), 3386, (3388), 3392, 3395.— § 147: <i>Devayānī</i> gave birth to a son. After 1,000 years had elapsed, <i>Śarmiṣṭhā</i> attained to puberty and prevailed upon Yayāti to beget a son also with her (I, <b>82</b>); to <i>Devayānī</i> she said that she had born the child to a <i>ṛṣi</i> whose name she had not dared to ask. The sons of <i>Devayānī</i> were <i>Yadu</i> and <i>Turvasu</i>, those of <i>Śarmiṣṭhā</i> were <i>Druhyu, Anu</i>, and <i>Pūru</i>. One day, when <i>Devayānī</i> was walking in the wood together with <i>Yayāti</i>, she met the children of <i>Śarmiṣṭhā</i> and asked them: “Who is your father?” They then pointed to <i>Yayāti.
