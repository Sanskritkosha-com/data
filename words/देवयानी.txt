On this she cursed the youth, who in return cursed her that she should become the wife of a Kṣatriya; (see कच). Once upon a time Devayānī and her companion Śarmiṣṭhā--the daughter of <lbinfo n='Vṛsha+parvan'/> Vṛshaparvan, the king of the Daityas, went to bathe keeping their clothes on the shore. But the god Wind <lbinfo n='chang+ed'/> changed their clothes, and when they were dressed they began to quarrel about the change until Śarmiṣṭhā so far lost her temper that she slapped <lbinfo n='Devayā+nī'/> Devayānī's face, and threw her into a well. There she remained until she was seen and rescued by Yayāti, who, with the consent of her father, married her, and Śarmiṣṭhā became her servant as a recompense for her insulting conduct towards her. Devayānī lived happily with Yayāti for some years and bore him two sons, Yadu and Turvasu. Subsequently her husband became <lbinfo n='ena+moured'/> enamoured of Śarmiṣṭhā, and Devayānī, feeling herself aggrieved, abruptly left her husband and went home to her father, who at her request condemned Yayāti with the infirmity of old age; see Yayāti also]."

(I, <b>80</b>). Surrounded by <i>Śarmiṣṭhā</i> and 2,000 maidens, <i>Devayānī</i> one day again met <i>Yayāti</i>, who at her request received her in marriage from <i>Śukra</i>, and promised that he would never invite <i>Śarmiṣṭhā</i> to share his bed (I, <b>81</b>): I, <b>78</b>, 3284, 3285, (3285), 3290, (3297), 3302, (3303), 3307, (3309), 3314; <b>79</b>, 3319, 3321, (3326); <b>80</b>, 3341, 3343, 3344, (3345), 3346, (3347), 3348, 3350, 3351, (3354), 3356, (3357); <b>81</b>, 3359, 3363, 3364, (3367), (3370), (3373), (3375), 3376, (3377), (3379), (3382), (3385), 3386, (3388), 3392, 3395.— § 147: <i>Devayānī</i> gave birth to a son.

The Princess became enraged, stripped her and cast her into a well and went away; when she was crying helpless there came Yayāti who was on a hunting expedition. He gave her his upper cloth to wear and lifted her up. Devayānī requested him to be her husband, saying that she had been cursed by Kaca, Bṛhaspati's son, to marry only a Kṣatriya. Yayāti agreed and departed. Devayāni reported Śarmiṣṭhā's conduct to her father Śukra who left the palace in disgust. The king implored him on his knees, when Śukra agreed to stay on if Śarmiṣṭhā would be appointed as servant of his daughter. This was agreed upon, and Śarmiṣṭhā became her servant. When Devayānī was married to Yayāti, Śukra presented Śarmiṣṭhā as his daughter's maid. She had two sons Yadu and Turvasu. Learning of her husband's connection with Śarmiṣṭhā during her own pregnancy, Devayānī left for her father's house. Yayāti followed her and was cursed by Śukra to fall a prey to old age. Yayāti appealed to him to mitigate the curse as his desire for enjoyment with his daughter was still keen. Then Śukra said that if anyone would give him his youth and take up old age then he could regain his youth. His son Pūru agreed and once more the king enjoyed the company of Devayānī;<sup>2</sup> heard the story of an ewe loved by a ram from Yayāti, and thought it was an allusion to her; became detached and cast off her body with her mind on Hari.<sup>3</sup> <F>1) Bhā.
