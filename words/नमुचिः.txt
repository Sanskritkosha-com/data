He offered to let Indra go provided he promised ‘not to kill by day or by night, with wet or dry’. Indra promised to do so and was released, but he cut off Namuci's head at twilight and with foam of water (which is neither wet nor dry). <lbinfo n='Ac+cording'/> According to another version Namuci was a friend of Indra, and once drank up his strength and made him quite imbecile. The Aśvins (and Sarasvatī also, as the story goes) then supplied Indra with a <i>Vajra</i> with which he cut off the demon's head]. <b>--2</b> <ab>N.</ab> of the god of love. <b>--Comp.</b> --सूदनः, --द्विष् --हन् <i><ab>m.</ab></i> epithets of Indra."
