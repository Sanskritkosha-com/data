Just then the two ancient deities (<i>pūrvadevau</i>), the Ṛṣis <i>Nara</i> and <i>Nārāyaṇa</i>, left the place. <i>Bṛhaspati</i> said to <i>Brahmán</i>: “Who are these two that leave the place without worshipping thee?” Brahmán said that they were <i>Nara</i> and <i>Nārāyaṇa</i> who had come from the world of men to the world of <i>Brahmán</i> (so Nīl.); “worshipped by the gods and the <i>Gandharvas</i> they exist only for the destruction of the Asuras.” Indra went to the spot where those two were practising austerities, accompanied by all the gods headed by <i>Bṛhaspati</i>. At that time the gods had been very much alarmed in consequence of a war with the <i>Asuras</i>. <i>Indra</i> obtained the boon that <i>Nara</i> and <i>Nārāyaṇa</i> (i.e. <i>Arjuna</i> and <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>) assisted him in the battle (cf. Arjuna). Both of them, by their acts, enjoy numerous eternal and celestial regions, and are repeatedly born in the times of war. Even this is what <i>Nārada</i>, conversant with the <i>Vedas</i>, had said to the Vṛṣṇis."
