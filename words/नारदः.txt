He is represented as a messenger from the gods to men and <i>vice versa</i>, and as being very fond of promoting discords among gods and men; hence his epithet of <i>Kalipriya</i>. He is said to have been the inventor of the lute or V<i>ina</i>. He is also the author of a code of laws which goes by his name]."
