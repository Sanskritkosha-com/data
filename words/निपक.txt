It would be possible to identify this occurrence of the word with <ab>mg.</ab> 2; it might mean <i>prudent, wise</i>, here; or contrariwise the occurrences under 2 might mean <i>zealous</i>. Further complication is caused by <b>niyaka</b>, which <lang>Tib.</lang> seems to interpret as the same as nipaka, suggesting graphic confusion; this is proposed in the <ls>Index to Mvy</ls> and in <ls>pw</ls> 〔7.352〕, where niyaka is assumed to stand for nipaka and the <ab>mg.</ab> <i>wise</i> is given for both <ls>Mvy</ls> passages, but doubtfully for the one here under discussion."
