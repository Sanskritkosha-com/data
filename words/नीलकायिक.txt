I have been unable to find anything more about this term. <lang>Tib.</lang> renders <tib>sṅon po</tib> (<i>blue</i>) <tib>ris</tib> (<i>form, figure</i>; also <i>party</i>, like <lang>BHS</lang> <b>kāya</b>). This suggests that <lang>Tib.</lang> understood <i>belonging to the group of Nīla (blue) ones</i>, rather than <i>blue-bodied</i>. In <ls>LV</ls> they, and their spokesman Vairocana, seem to be superior to the four <b>mahārāja</b> gods."
