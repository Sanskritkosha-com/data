Not only is this a long distance for a ‘bridge of boats’, but in line 12, as a result of this arrangement, Upagupta <i>mounts on a ship</i> (nāvam abhiruhya) and proceeds to Pāṭaliputra. Here, at least, the <ab>mg.</ab> seems then to be <i>course for boats, water-way, navigable passage for ships</i>; and this is possible in all the other passages."
