            "content": "(8) <i>Pāṭaliputra</i>¦ (No. 7, L. 12; No. 6, L. 4; No. 1, L. 14): It is the same as modern Patna situated to the south of the river Gaṅgā. Inscription No. 7 refers to Pāṭaliputra. Inscription No. 6 mentions Vīrasena, the child of Kutsa, the minister for peace and war under Candragupta II, who knew the meanings of the words, and logic, and (the ways of) mankind, who was a poet and who belonged to (the city of) Pāṭaliputra.<sup>290</sup> Inscription No. 1 mentions a city named Puṣpa where Samudragupta enjoyed playfully while he was young.<sup>291</sup> Apparently, the city was the Gupta capital. We also find the word Pāṭaliputa (Pāṭaliputra) used by Aśoka, in his rock edicts.<sup>292</sup> The city was also known as Kusumapura due to the abundance of flowers.<sup>293</sup> Its name Puṣpapura is also met with in the Raghuvaṃśa.<sup>294</sup> It is mentioned in the Mudrārākṣasa as well.<sup>295</sup> The Kathāsaritsāgara of Somadeva<sup>296</sup> (11th century) describes it as a place of both wealth and education though generally there is a fight between Śrī (lakṣmī) and Sarasvatī.<sup>297</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>The Kāvyamīmāṃsā of Rājaśekhara (A.D. 900) mentions a tradition that there were assemblies of scholars called brahmasabhās, organised by kings, which examined poets like Kālidāsa, Bhartṛmaṇṭha, Amara, Rūpa, Āryaśūra, Bhāravi and Candragupta in Viśālā (Ujjainī) and where such great masters of grammar as Upavarṣa, Pāṇini, Piṅgala, Vyāḍi, Vararūci and Patañjali were examined in Pāṭaliputra and attained fame.<sup>298</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>The Mañjuśrīmūlakalpa<sup>299</sup> (A.D. 800) mentions Pāṭaliputra as Nandanagara. This work refers to king Nanda, his learned Council of brāhmaṇa philosophers and to his intimacy with Pāṇini. “After him (Sūrasena) there will be king Nanda at Puṣpa city. In the capital of the Magadha residents there will be brāhmaṇa controversialists and the king will be surrounded by them. The king will give them riches. His minister was a Buddhist brāhmaṇa, Vararūci, who was of high soul, kind and good. His great friend was a brāhmaṇa, Pāṇini by name”.<sup>300</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>The Kāśikā<sup>301</sup> records two divisions of Pāṭaliputra: <dvsn n='P'/>1. Pūrva-Pāṭaliputra (eastern on the Gaṅgā) <dvsn n='P'/>2. Apara-Pāṭaliputra (western on the Śoṇa) <dvsn n='P'/>Patañjali<sup>302</sup> mentions the western Pāṭaliputra. A citizen of Pāṭaliputra was called Pāṭaliputraka.<sup>303</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>The city is named as Palibothra by Megasthenes, the Ambassador of Seleucus Nicator at the court of King Candragupta Maurya.<sup>304</sup> The Pāla inscriptions refer to it by the name Śrīnagara.<sup>305</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>The termination ‘Putra’ in Pāṭaliputra is difficult to explain. We find it being used with ‘Brahman’ to denote the river ‘Brahmaputra’. As regards places-names we find the mention of Saitya puta (Satiya-putra) and Kerala-puta (Kerala putra) in Aśokan Rock-edicts.<sup>306</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>The name Pāṭaliputra is taken to mean “the son (putra) of Pāṭali, i. e. the trumpet flower. The words Puṣpapura and Kusumapura also mean ‘a city of flowers’. The word ‘Śrīnagara’ means ‘a beautiful city.<sup>307</sup> Because of the abundance of flowers the city may have looked beautiful. It was known by other names also, viz., Puṣpapura, Puspapurī and Kusumapura.<sup>308</sup> According to Yuan-Chwang, it had been called Kusumapura (K' u-su-mo-pu-lo) on account of the numerous flowers (kusuma) in the royal enclosure.<sup>309</sup> Later its glory was replaced by that of Kānyakubja which came to be known as Kusumapura.<sup>310</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>The meaning of ‘Pāṭaliputra’ is explained in the legendary origin of the city. According to the legend: there was a brāhmaṇa of high talent and singular learning. Many flocked to him to receive instruction. One day all his students went out on a tour of observation. One of them looked very sad. When asked, he told that his life was waning without any company. In a joke his friends made the Pāṭali tree, under which they were standing, his father-in-law: in other words he was to marry the daughter of the tree, or a Pāṭali flower (Bignonia Suaveloens).<sup>311</sup> As the Sun was about to set, all the students proposed to return home but the young student fascinated by love stayed there fearlessly. Accidentally, next day he was married with the young daughter of an old couple. After a year his wife gave birth to a son. He declined to stay there fearing the exposure to wind and weather. But the old man (the father of the wife) constructed a house for him and made him stay there. When the old capital of Kusumapura was changed, this town was chosen, and “as the genie built the mansion for the youth the country was named as Pāṭaliputrapura (the city of the son of the Pāṭali tree).”<sup>312</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>It is not unlikely that originally the name of the city was Pāṭaliputrapura and that later suffix Pura was dropped. <dvsn n='P'/>The Buddhist literature informs us that Pāṭaliputra was originally a village known as Pāṭaligāma. Ajātaśatru is said to have fortified it in order to check the attacks of the Licchavis who often harassed its inhabitants. The Buddha on his way from Rājagṛha to Vaiśālī, passed through this village on his last journey and is said to have predicted that the village was destined to become a great city.<sup>313</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>The Vāyu-Purāṇa attributes the real foundation of Pāṭaliputra to Rājā Ajāta-Śatru's grandson, Udaya or Udayāśva. It was he who first removed the capital from Rājagṛha to Pāṭaliputra (during the last part of the 6th century B.C.)<sup>314</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>Pāṭaliputra had closely been associated with multifarious political and cultural activities right from the fifth century B.C. to the later part of the sixth century A.D.<sup>315</sup> It had the honour to be the capital of the Śaiśunāgas, the Nandas, the Mauryas and the great Imperial Guptas until the Hūṇa invasion in the 6th century A.D. when it was ruined. Harṣavardhana (7th century A.D.) made no attempt to restore it.<sup>316</sup> Śaśāṅka Narendragupta destroyed many Buddhist temples and monasteries at Pāṭaliputra.<sup>317</sup> Dharmapāla, the most powerful of the Pāla kings of Bengal and Bihar, tried to restore its glory.<sup>318</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>Coming to medieval times, we find that it remained deserted for a number of centuries. It was Sher Shah, who, in about A.D. 1541 occupied it again as a royal city and built a fort there. It then came into importance under its modern name Patna (from Skt. Pattana) i. e. the town or city. It is even now the capital of Bihar.<sup>319</sup>"
