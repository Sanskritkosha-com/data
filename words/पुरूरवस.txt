He fell in love with Urvashi while she was descending from heaven. Urvashi returned his love and became his wife. The king passed many happy days in her company and had one son by her. After some days the nymph returned to her home leaving the king to mourn her loss; but she repeated her visits five times successively and bore five sons to the king. Purūravas was not however, satisfied and longed for an inseparable union with her. This he secured by, celebrating many sacrifices. The story has its origin in a passage in Haribansha where Urvashī is represented as going to live with Purūravas on certain conditions, the accidental violation of which made her leave the king. 2. A demigod, of the class of Viswadevas. E. पुरु much, रु to sound, Unādi aff. असि, form irr."
