[He saw the nymph Urvaśī, while <lbinfo n='de+scending'/> descending upon earth owing to the curse of Mitra and Varuṇa, and fell in love with her. Urvaśī, too, was enamoured of the king who was as renowned for <lbinfo n='per+sonal'/> personal beauty as for truthfulness, <lbinfo n='devo+tion'/> devotion, and generosity, and became his wife. They lived happily together for many days, and after she had borne him a son, she returned to the heaven. The king heavily mourned her loss, and she was pleased to repeat her visits five <lbinfo n='suc+cessive'/> successive times and bore him five sons. But the king, who wanted her life-long company, was not evidently satisfied with this; and he obtained his desired object after he had offered oblations as directed by the Gandharvas. The story told in Vikramorvaśīya differs in many respects; so does the account given in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, based on a passage in the Ṛgveda, where it is said that Urvaśī agreed to live with <lbinfo n='Purū+ravas'/> Purūravas on two conditions:--namely that her two rams which she loved as children must be kept near her bed-side and <lbinfo n='ne+ver'/> never suffered to be carried away, and that he must take care never to be seen by her undressed. The Gandharvas, however, carried away the rams, and so Urvaśī disappeared]."
