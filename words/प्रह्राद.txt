Whereupon Prahlāda struck the pillar with his fist (according to another account, Hiraṇya-Kaśipu himself <lbinfo n='an+grily'/> angrily kicked the pillar to convince his son of the absurdity of his faith), when Viṣṇu came out half-man and half-lion, and tore Hiraṇya-Kaśipu to pieces. <lbinfo n='Pra+hlāda'/> Prahlāda succeeded his father, and reigned wisely and righteously.]"
