She sat down to boil the jujubes, but in vain; the day was about to wane; her fuel was all consumed; then she first thrust her feet into the fire, without changing a muscle of her face. <i>Indra</i> then showed himself in his own proper form, and said that her wish would be accomplished; throwing off her body, she would live with him in heaven as his spouse; and this <i>tīrtha</i> would be the foremost in the world and be called <i>B.</i>; he granted her a boon superior to that granted to <i>Arundhatī</i> (<i>z</i>) by <i>Mahādeva</i>: the person who will reside in this <i>tīrtha</i> for only one night and bathe there with his soul fixed on meditation, will, after having thrown off his body, obtain many regions of blessedness difficult of acquisition. Then <i>Indra</i> went back to heaven; a shower of celestial flowers poured down, etc., and <i>Śrutāvatī</i>, throwing off her body, became the spouse of <i>Indra</i>.—Cf. Badarīpācana."
