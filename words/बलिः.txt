[He was a son of Virecana, the son of Prahlāda. He was a very powerful <lbinfo n='de+mon'/> demon and oppressed the gods very much. They, therefore, prayed to Viṣṇu for succour, who descended on earth as a son of Kaśyapa and Aditi in the form of a dwarf. He assumed the dress of a mendicant, and having gone to Bali prayed him to give him as much earth as he could cover in three steps. Bali, who was noted for his liberality, <lbinfo n='un+hesitatingly'/> unhesitatingly acceded to this apparently simple request. But the dwarf soon <lbinfo n='as+sumed'/> assumed a mighty form, and began to measure the three steps. The first step covered the earth, the second the heavens; and not knowing where to place the third, he planted it on the head of Bali and sent him and all his legions to the Pātāla and allowed him to be its ruler. Thus the universe was once more restored to the rule of Indra; <ab>cf.</ab> छलयसि विक्रमणे बलिमद्भुतवामन <ls>Gīt. 1</ls>; <ls>R. 7. 35</ls>; <ls>Me. 57.</ls> Viṣṇu is said to still guard his door in Pāṭāla.
