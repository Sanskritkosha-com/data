Gaz.,</i> Vol. XXI, p. 354); see <i>Maṇḍaleśvara</i> essentially meaning ‘the ruler of a <i>maṇḍala</i> or district’; also called <i>Mahāmaṇḍalika,</i> etc., cf. <i>Mahāmaṇḍaleśvar-ādhipati.</i> The status of a <i>Mahāmaṇdal-</i> <i>eśvara</i> seems to have been superior to that of a <i>Maṇḍaleśvara,</i> while <i>Mahāmaṇḍaleśvarādhipati</i> apparently enjoyed a still higher rank."
