But Yayāti fell in love with this servant and <lbinfo n='pri+vately'/> privately married her. Aggrieved at this Devayānī went to her father and <lbinfo n='com+plained'/> complained of the conduct of her husband, on whom, therefore, Śukra inflicted premature infirmity and old age. Yayāti, however, propitiated him and obtained from him permission to transfer his decrepitude to any one who would <lbinfo n='con+sent'/> consent to take it. He asked his five sons, but all refused except Puru, the <lbinfo n='young+est'/> youngest. Yayāti accordingly transferred his infirmity to Puru, and being once more in the prime of youth, passed his time in the enjoyment of sensual <lbinfo n='pleas+ures'/> pleasures. This he did for 1000 years, and yet his desire was not satisfied. At last, however, with a vigorous effort he renounced his sensual life, restored his youth to Puru, and, having made him successor to the throne, repaired to the woods to lead a pious life and meditate upon the Supreme Spirit]."
