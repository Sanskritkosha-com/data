But Yayāti fell in love with this servant and <lbinfo n='pri+vately'/> privately married her. Aggrieved at this Devayānī went to her father and <lbinfo n='com+plained'/> complained of the conduct of her husband, on whom, therefore, Śukra inflicted premature infirmity and old age. Yayāti, however, propitiated him and obtained from him permission to transfer his decrepitude to any one who would <lbinfo n='con+sent'/> consent to take it. He asked his five sons, but all refused except Puru, the <lbinfo n='young+est'/> youngest. Yayāti accordingly transferred his infirmity to Puru, and being once more in the prime of youth, passed his time in the enjoyment of sensual <lbinfo n='pleas+ures'/> pleasures. This he did for 1000 years, and yet his desire was not satisfied. At last, however, with a vigorous effort he renounced his sensual life, restored his youth to Puru, and, having made him successor to the throne, repaired to the woods to lead a pious life and meditate upon the Supreme Spirit]."

He then recited some verses (vv. 3174—3177) and took back from his son his own decrepitude, giving him back his youth. He then installed <i>Pūru</i> on the throne, saying that he was his true heir, and should continue the lineage which should be named after him. <i>Y</i>. then retired to <i>Bhṛgutuṅga</i>, and having spent a long time in ascetism, observing the vow of fasting, he died and ascended to heaven with his wives (I, <b>75</b>): I, <b>75</b>, 3164, 3171, 3172.—§ 145 (Kaca): I, <b>76</b>, 3183 (<i>daśamo yaḥ Prajāpateḥ</i>), 3185, 3186 (<i>Devayānyāś ca saṃyogaṃ</i> <i>Y°er Nāhuṣasya ca</i>).—§ 146 (Devayānī): I, <b>78</b>, 3292 (<i>Nahuṣātmajaḥ</i>), 3301; <b>81</b>, (3366), (3369), (3372), 3372, (3374), (3376), (3378), (3381), (3383), 3387, (3390), 3394 (<i>Y</i>. married Devayānī and promised not to cohabit with Śarmiṣṭhā).—§ 147 (do.): I, <b>82</b>, 3397, (3410), (3414), (3416) (Śarmiṣṭhā prevailed upon <i>Y</i>. to beget sons on her); <b>83</b>, 3432 (the sons of <i>Y</i>. were the foll.: with Devayānī Yadu and Turvasu, with Śarmiṣṭhā Druhyu, Anu and Pūru), 3434, 3450, 3452, (3455), 3460 (<i>Nāhuṣaḥ</i>), (3461), (3463) (Uśanas cursed <i>Y</i>. to be overcome with decrepitude, etc.).—§ 148 (cf.

Sambhavap.): Having installed <i>Pūru</i> on the throne, <i>Y</i>. entered the wood to lead the life of a hermit for 1,000 years and then ascended to <i>Svarga</i> (I, <b>86</b>), where he was reverenced by the gods, the <i>Sādhyas</i>, the <i>Maruts</i>, and the <i>Vasus</i>, wandering about in <i>Devaloka</i> and <i>Brahmaloka</i>. One day <i>Indra</i> asked him what he had said to <i>Pūru</i> when he bestowed the kingdom upon him. <i>Y</i>. answered that he had said: “The whole country between the <i>Gaṅgā</i> and the <i>Yamunā</i> is thine, this is the central region of the earth, the outlying regions will be the dominions of thy brothers. Those without anger are ever superior to those under its sway, etc.” (I, <b>87</b>). As <i>Y</i>. said that he did not know his equal in ascetic austerities among men, gods, <i>Gandharvas</i>, and <i>maharṣis, Indra</i> declared that, owing to this haughtiness, he should fall from heaven, yet he should fall among the virtuous. When falling, he was beheld by the <i>rājarṣi</i> <i>Aṣṭaka</i> (I, <b>88</b>), of whom he was the maternal grandfather; <i>Y</i>. spoke disapprovingly of haughtiness, etc., and told that, leaving earth, he had obtained many high regions for 1,000 years, then he had dwelt in the town of <i>Indra</i> (having 1,000 gates and extending 1,000 yojanas all around) for 1,000 years, then for 1,000 years in the world of <i>Prajāpati</i>, then in the abode of <i>Devadeva</i> (i.e. Viṣṇu); he had also dwelt in <i>Nandana</i> for 100 ayutas of years, assuming any form at will, sporting with the Apsarases; then there had come a messenger of the gods with a grim visage, who thrice had shouted to him “fall”; then he had fallen from <i>Nandana</i>, hearing, while falling, the compassionate exclamations of the gods, who had directed him to fall to the sacrificial place of <i>Aṣṭaka</i> and his companions (I, <b>89</b>). <i>Y</i>. continued: Those who speak of their own merits after having dwelt for 60,000 or 80,000 years in heaven, are doomed to suffer the pains of the hell called <i>bhauma</i> (i.e. existence on the earth), and are attacked by certain <i>Rākṣasas</i> with sharp teeth. <i>Y</i>. then taught the lore of transmigration and emancipation (I, <b>90</b>). <i>Y</i>. explained the duties of <i>gṛhasthas, bhikṣus, brahmacārins</i>, and <i>vānaprasthas</i>, and the different kinds of <i>munis</i> and <i>mauna</i> (vows of silence) (I, <b>91</b>). <i>Y</i>. then said: “I now shall fall into the <i>bhauma</i> hell, the <i>Lokapas</i> of Brahmán hasten me thither.” The kings <i>Aṣṭaka, Pratardana</i> (I, <b>92</b>), <i>Vasu-</i> <i>manas Auṣadaśvi</i>, and <i>Śibi Auśīnara</i>, offered him their <i>“lokas”</i> and volunteered to go to hell (<i>naraka</i>) in his place; <i>Y</i>. did not accept the offer. Then appeared five golden chariots, in which they all five ascended to heaven, <i>Śibi</i> leaving the others behind him. <i>Y</i>. told them that he was their maternal grandfather, that he had given the whole earth with her horses, etc., to brahmans, and that the earth and the firmament and fire existed owing to his truth. *(I, <b>93</b>): I, <b>86</b>, 3535 (<i>Nākuṣo rājā</i>), 3541, 3543, 3544 (<i>Nāhuṣaḥ</i>); <b>87</b>, 3553, (3555); <b>88</b>, †3564, (3565), (†3567), †3568, †3569; <b>89</b>, (†3577), †3577 (<i>Nahuṣasya putraḥ Pūroḥ pitā</i>), (†3580), †3589, (†3591), †3598; <b>90</b>, (†3601), (†3603), (†3606), (†3609), (†3613), (†3617), (†3621); <b>91</b>, (†3628), (3635), (3637); <b>92</b>, (3646), (†3651), (†3654), (†3656), (†3659), (†3661), †3663; <b>93</b>, (†3665), (†3667), (†3670), (†3672), (3674), (3676), (3678), (3681), (†3684), †3684 (<i>Nahuṣasya</i> <i>putraḥ Pūroḥ pitā</i>).—§ 156 (Pūruvaṃś.): I, <b>95</b>, ††3760 (son of Nahuṣa, husband of Devayānī and Śarmiṣṭhā, enumeration of his sons).—§ 267 (Yamasabhāv.): II, <b>8</b>, 319 (in the palace of Yama).—§ 273 (Rājasūyārambhap.): II, <b>14</b>, 570 (<i>°es tv eva Bhojānāṃ vistaro guṇato mahān</i>).—§ 296 (Dyūtap.): II, <b>56</b>, 1930 (<i>yathā</i>).—§ 320 (Saubhavadhap.): III, <b>21</b>, 841 (<i>prapatataḥ Y°eḥ kṣīnapuṇyasya svargād iva</i>). —§ 345 (Nalopākhyānap.): III, <b>57</b>, 2235 (<i>īje cāpy aśva-</i> <i>medhena Y°ir iva Nāhuṣaḥ</i>).—§ 376 (Tīrthayātrāp.): III, <b>85</b>, 8268 (<i>yathā</i>).—§ 377 (Dhaumyatīrthak.): III, <b>89</b>, 8363 (<i>Viśvāmitranadī…yāsyās tīre satāṃ madhye Y°ir Nahu-</i> <i>ṣātmajaḥ papāta sa punar lokāṃl lebhe dharmān sanātanān</i>, cf. § 149).—§ 378 (Tīrthayātrāp.): III, <b>92</b>, 8444 (<i>yathā</i>).— § 402 (do.): III, <b>120</b>, †10260 (<i>nāthāḥ Śaibyādayaḥ…</i> <i>yathā Y°eḥ</i>, all. to § 149).—§ 409<i>c</i> (Plakṣāvataraṇag.): <i>Y</i>. competed with <i>Indra</i>.

He fell down among his daughter's sons <i>Pratardana, Vasumanas, Śibi</i>, and <i>Aṣṭaka</i>, in the <i>Naimiṣa</i> wood, where they performed a <i>vājapeya</i> sacrifice. They gave him their merits (<i>puṇya</i>, <i>dharma</i>, etc.), and the result of all their sacrifices. <i>Mādhavī</i> also came and gave him the moiety of hers, likewise <i>Gālava</i>, who gave him the eighth part of his (V, <b>121</b>).

She was Devayānī, the daughter of Śukra and she became his wife and bore him two sons, Yadu and Turvasu. Śukra in offering his daughter to the king asked him not to share his bed with Śarmiṣṭhā. In a weak moment, forgetting his promise, he yielded to the entreaties of Śarmiṣṭhā and on this Devayānī departed to Śukra's place. Yayāti followed her and was cursed by Śukra to become old; but Śukra said that he could take the youth of somebody by exchanging it for his old age. He enquired of all his sons and all except Pūru refused to comply with his request. With Pūru's youth he enjoyed for long the company of Devayānī; narrated to her an old story of an ewe found in a well, loving a ram, who was not faithful at first but who spent ultimately a long time of enjoyment with her. He compared himself to that ram and said that he should thereafter bestow his thought on Hari. So he returned his youth to Pūru and led a life of penance at Bhṛgutunga after anointing Pūru on the throne and appointing his other sons in different parts of the kingdom; discourses of, to Pūru on gentleness and friendliness to all; was devoted to Hari. Parīkṣit compared to Yayāti for his <i>dharma.</i><sup>3</sup> Cursed that Yadu and his line be debarred from succeeding to the throne, though five dynasties of his sons are distinguished like the sun's rays.<sup>4</sup> Tenth in generation from Prajāpati.<sup>5</sup> Went to heaven but Indra sent him back; one version is that he stands in the <i>antarikṣa</i> and the other is that he went back to heaven; met Indra and narrated Pūru's coronation: Indra told him of the completion of his righteousness and hence birth on the earth.<sup>6</sup> Falling down, met Aṣṭaka and the other grandsons, who cleared him of his doubts regarding the course of fate and man's helplessress, the fruits of karma, the worlds enjoyed by him, the bhauma naraka, the means to get samjñā, and the duties of four āśramas and munis.<sup>7</sup> These with Pratardana, Vasuman and Śibi offered a part of their puṇyam to make Yayāti enjoy heaven.
