(Rākṣasa) form;<sup>1</sup> when she came to know of the proposal of her eldest brother Rukmi (s.v.) to give her in marriage to Caidya, she sent a letter through a Brāhmaṇa to Kṛṣṇa showing her unflinching devotion to him and requesting that she might be carried off when she would be on her way to the Devī temple on the day prior to the wedding as was the custom. That day she had her bath and decked herself with two clothes and many jewels. Her anxiety at not having heard from Kṛṣṇa, when the Brāhmaṇa came to tell her that Kṛṣṇa would do the needful. Citizens were also for her marriage with Kṛṣṇa. Well guarded and accompanied by singing and dancing, Rukmiṇī entered the temple and prayed for Kṛṣṇa's hand. After worshipping Indrāṇī nearby she returned when Kṛṣṇa carried her away in his chariot. Seeing the party of Caidya pursuing him, Rukmiṇī became nervous when Kṛṣṇa consoled her. When Caidya was about to be killed by Kṛṣṇa she appealed to the Lord to spare him; Rāma consoled her. The regular marriage and festivities followed.<sup>2</sup> Mother of 11 sons and a daughter; gave birth to Pradyumna who was stolen by Śambara and thrown into the sea. Recovered and taken back by Māyāvatī alias Ratī; Rukmiṇī remembered her lost son and wondered at his exact resemblance. At that time came Kṛṣṇa and Nārada who explained the history of Pradyumna to her great joy;<sup>3</sup> was the chief queen of Kṛṣṇa and more attached; would not like to be away from Kṛṣṇa; when she was once fanning him gently Kṛṣṇa cut a joke that his status was poor and that she could even then get married to a rich prince and enjoy luxuries. Rukmiṇī wept in deep distress and spoke words reiterating her full devotion to him. Kṛṣṇa consoled her assuring her of his loyalty.<sup>4</sup> Grave concern at Kṛṣṇa not returning from the cave of Jāmbavan for a long time. Her daughter Cārumatī was married to the son of Kṛtavarman.<sup>5</sup> Attended the marriage of Aniruddha and Rocanā at Bhojakaṭa; out of regard for her and Balarāma, Kṛṣṇa said nothing on Rukmi's death.<sup>6</sup> Explained to Draupadī how she became married to Kṛṣṇa; welcomed to Hāstinapura by Kuntī and Draupadī; served Kucela, a friend and classmate of Kṛṣṇa.<sup>7</sup> Entered fire on Kṛṣṇa's decease;<sup>8</sup> is Lakṣmī.<sup>9</sup> <F>1) Bhā.
