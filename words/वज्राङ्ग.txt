He came in search of his wife whom he found crying in fear. She spoke of the insult offered by Indra and asked for a son, Tāraka, able to vanquish Indra. Then again he entered into a terrible vow when Brahmā blessed him with the son desired by his spouse. Tāraka was born and great festivities were held in his honour. Soon he was crowned king of the Asura world. <div n='P'/>M. 146. 5, 41 ff; 147. 1-29."
