            "content": "<b>Vasiṣṭhāpavāha</b>¦ (“the carrying away of Vasiṣṭha”), name of a tīrtha. § 615 (Baladevatīrthayātrā): IX, <b>41</b>, †2357; <b>42</b>, †2358.—§ 615<i>p</i> (do.): A great enmity arose between <i>Viśvāmitra</i> and <i>Vasiṣṭha</i>, due to their rivalry in respect of ascetic austerities. The hermitage of <i>Vasiṣṭha</i> was in <i>Sthāṇutīrtha</i>, on the bank of the <i>Sarasvatī</i>; on the opposite bank was the hermitage of <i>Viśvāmitra</i>. There (i.e. in <i>Sthāṇutīrtha</i>) <i>Sthāṇu</i> had practised penances, and having performed a sacrifice and worshipped the <i>Sarasvatī</i> he had established that tīrtha, and there the gods in days of yore installed <i>Skanda</i>. In that tīrtha on the <i>Sarasvatī</i>, the <i>ṛṣi</i> <i>Viśvāmitra</i>, by his penances, disturbed <i>Vasiṣṭha. Viśvāmitra</i> and <i>Vasiṣṭha</i> every day challenged each other in respect of the superiority of their penances. <i>Viśvāmitra</i> ordered the <i>Sarasvatī</i>, notwithstanding her trembling, to bring <i>Vasiṣṭha</i> into his presence, that he might slay him. <i>Vasiṣṭha</i> willingly let her do so, lest <i>Viśvāmitra</i> should curse her. <i>Sarasvatī</i> washed away one of her banks and bore <i>Vasiṣṭha</i> (who praised the <i>Sarasvatī (q</i>)) away and informed <i>Kauśika</i> (i.e. <i>Viśvāmitra</i>) about his arrival; but while <i>Viśvāmitra</i> was looking for a weapon she quickly bore <i>Vasiṣṭha</i> back to the eastern bank. <i>Viśvāmitra</i> cursed her, saying that her current should be changed into blood, which is acceptable only to the <i>Rākṣasas</i>. For a whole year she then flowed bearing blood mixed with water. The gods, the <i>Gandharvas</i>, and the <i>Apsarases</i> grieved. For this reason the tīrtha came to be called <i>V. Sarasvatī</i>, however, once more got back her own proper condition (IX, <b>42</b>), when some <i>munis</i> on a <i>tīrthayātrā</i> to the <i>Sarasvatī</i>, having bathed in all her tīrthas came to <i>V</i>. and saw the water mixed with blood, and that innumerable <i>Rākṣasas</i> were drinking it. Having learnt the cause, they worshipped <i>Mahādeva</i> with penances and purified the <i>Sarasvatī</i>. The <i>Rākṣasas</i>, who were <i>Brahma-Rākṣasas</i> (so those among <i>vaiśyas, śūdras</i>, and <i>kṣatriyas</i>, who hate and injure the brahmans, become <i>Rākṣasas</i>), afflicted with hunger, sought the protection of the <i>munis</i>, who, having ordained what should be the food of the <i>Rākṣasas (r</i>) solicited the <i>Sarasvatī</i>, who assumed a new shape called <i>Aruṇā</i>; bathing in that new river the <i>Rākṣasas</i> abandoned their bodies and went to heaven. Ascertaining all this, <i>Indra(s</i>) bathed there and became purified of a grievous sin (i.e. <i>brahmahatyā</i>): IX, <b>42</b>, 2398."
