The <i>Gandharva</i> said: <i>Vasiṣṭha</i> is <i>Brahmán's</i> spiritual son and <i>Arundhatī's</i> husband; <i>Kāma</i> and <i>Krodha</i>, who cannot be vanquished even by the immortals, used to shampoo his feet. Though his wrath was excited by <i>Viśvāmitra's</i> offence, he did not yet exterminate the <i>Kuśikas</i>. Afflicted at the loss of his sons, he did not do any dreadful deed for the destruction of <i>Viśvāmitra</i>. He did not transgress <i>Kṛtānta</i> (Death) in order to bring back his lost children from the abode of <i>Yama</i>. It was by obtaining him that the <i>Ikṣvākus</i> acquired this earth, and with him as their <i>purohita</i>, they performed many great sacrifices. “Therefore acquire a fit <i>purohita</i>” (I, <b>174</b>). <i>Arjuna</i> wished to hear of the hostility between <i>Viśvāmitra</i> and <i>Vasiṣṭha</i>. The <i>Gandharva</i> said: This old (<i>purāṇa</i>) story of <i>Vasiṣṭha</i> they tell in all worlds. In <i>Kānyakubja</i> king <i>Gādhi</i>, son of <i>Kuśika</i>, had a son <i>Viśvāmitra</i>, who, with his ministers, used to go a hunting. Once he arrived at the hermitage of <i>Vasiṣṭha</i>, who offered him <i>arghya</i>, etc. from his cow <i>Nandinī</i>, who yielded everything desired; <i>Viśvāmitra</i> asked <i>Vasiṣṭha</i> to give him <i>Nandinī</i> for an <i>arbuda</i> of kine or his kingdom, but in vain. Then he wanted to take the cow by force. She repaired to <i>Vasiṣṭha</i>, who at first did nothing, saying, “I am a forgiving <i>brahman</i>”; but at last he said: “I do not abandon you! Stay if you can!” Hearing this word, the cow attacked <i>Viśvāmitra's</i> troops; from her tail she began to rain showers of burning coals; from her tail she brought forth <i>Pahlavas</i>, from her udders <i>Drāviḍas</i> and <i>Śakas</i>, from her womb (<i>yonideśāt) Yavanas</i>, from her dung (<i>śakṛt) Śabaras</i>, from her urine <i>Kāñcis</i>, and from her sides <i>Śarabhas</i> (B. <i>Śabarān</i> and <i>kāṃścid</i> instead of <i>Kāñcīn</i>), and from the froth of her mouth <i>Pauṇḍras, Kirātas, Yavanas, Siṃhalas, Barbaras, Vaśas</i> (B. <i>Khaśān</i>), <i>Civukas, Pulindas, Cīnas, Hūṇas, Keralas</i>, and other <i>Mlecchas</i>, who attacked <i>Viśvāmitra's</i> soldiers. <i>Viśvāmitra's</i> troops fied, but none was deprived of life. <i>Viśvāmitra</i> then, disgusted with <i>kṣatriya</i> prowess (“<i>brahman</i> prowess is true prowess”), set his mind on asceticism, and finally became a <i>brahman</i> and drank <i>soma</i> with <i>Indra</i> (I, <b>175</b>).—§ 224: <i>Kalmāṣapāda</i> (q.v.)—§ 225. <i>Vasiṣṭha</i> patiently bore his grief, and resolved rather to sacrifice his own life than exterminate the <i>Kauśikas</i>. He threw himself down from the summit of <i>Meru</i>, entered a huge fire in the forest, and tied a strong weight to his neck and threw himself into the sea, but all in vain, and, in distress of heart, he returned to his hermitage (I, <b>176</b>). Beholding it bereft of his children, he left it again and tied himself strongly with cords and flung himself into a mighty river, but the stream cut those cords and cast the <i>ṛṣi</i> ashore, whence that river was called <i>Vipāśā</i>. Once more he threw himself into a river flowing from <i>Himavat (Haimavatī</i>), but the river immediately fled in 100 different directions, and has since been known by the name of the <i>Śatadru</i> (<i>“śatadhā vidrutā”</i>, v. 6753). He now again went towards his hermitage, and was on the way addressed by <i>Adṛśyantī</i>, the wife of <i>Śaktri</i>, who had for twelve years borne his child in her womb. Hearing that child in the womb reciting the <i>Vedas</i> with the six <i>Aṅgas, Vasiṣṭha</i> refrained from self-destruction, and, accompanied by <i>Adṛśyantī</i>, returned to his hermitage. One day he saw <i>Kalmāṣapāda</i>, who would devour him; <i>Adṛśyantī</i> was terrified, but <i>Vasiṣṭha</i> restrained him by uttering <i>“huṃ”</i>, and, sprinkling him with water sanctified by <i>mantras</i>, and freed him from his curse that had lasted twelve years. <i>Kalmāṣapāda</i> promised never more to insult <i>brahmans</i>, and prevailed upon <i>Vasiṣṭha</i> that he accompanied him to his capital <i>Ayodhyā</i> and begat a son for him on the queen. Then he went back to his hermitage. After twelve years the queen tore open her womb by a stone, and then was born the <i>rājarṣi Aśmaka</i>, who founded the city of <i>Paudanya</i> (I, <b>177</b>).—§ 226: <i>Parāśara</i> (q.v.)."
