The words visāriṇī kṛṣṇā perhaps corruptly represent an <lex>abl.</lex> phrase, <i>from his evil course</i> (<ab>cf.</ab> <b>kṛṣṇa</b> 1). As they stand, they could apparently only be a strange parenthetical clause; <i>the corruption</i> (? visāriṇī, or viśār° ?) <i>was black (dark, evil)</i>. The Index to <ab>ed.</ab> renders kṛṣṇā by <i>tongue of fire</i>, which seems unacceptable; presumably it takes visā° as <i>spreading</i>; but even with the <ab>em.</ab> to nivāryamāṇā this hardly gives an intelligible result."
