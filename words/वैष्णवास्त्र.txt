The Earth (<i>Pṛthivī</i>), knowing that that time had come, asked of him as a boon for [her son] <i>Naraka</i>, that he, possessed of the <i>Vaiṣṇavāstra</i>, should become incapable of being slain by gods and Asuras. The boon was granted. From <i>Naraka</i>, the king of <i>Prāgjyotiṣa</i> (i.e. Bhagadatta) got this weapon, that may slay even <i>Indra</i> and <i>Rudra</i>: VII, <b>29</b>, 1284, [1285 (<i>astraṃ…Vaiṣṇavaṃ</i>)]."
