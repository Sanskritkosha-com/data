Indra was afraid of him, and sent the <i>devakanyā</i> (cf. v. 5078: <i>apsarasaṃ</i>) Jānapadī to disturb him. He fled from her; but from his seed that had fallen upon a clump of reeds (<i>śarastambe</i>) sprung two children, whom a soldier found and brought to king <i>Śāntanu. Śāntanu</i>, from pity (<i>kṛpā</i>, v. 5089), brought them up as his own children, whence he called them <i>Kṛpa</i> and <i>Kṛpī. Ś</i>. by his <i>tapas</i> learnt what had happened and came to <i>Śāntanu</i> and told him his lineage, etc. He then instructed <i>Kṛpa</i> in the fourfold <i>Dhanurveda</i> and various <i>śāstras</i>, and in a short time <i>Kṛpa</i> became an eminent teacher, who instructed the <i>Dhārtarāṣṭras, Pāṇḍavas, Yādavas, Vṛṣṇis</i>, and other princes from various countries in the <i>Dhanurveda</i>: I, <b>130</b>, 5072 (<i>Gautamaḥ</i>), 5077, 5083 (<i>Gautamasya</i>).—§ 572 (Rathātirathas.): V, <b>166</b>, 5768 (<i>Gautamasya maharṣer ya ācāryasya</i> <i>Ś°aḥ śarastambāt suto 'bhavat</i>, i.e. Kṛpa).
