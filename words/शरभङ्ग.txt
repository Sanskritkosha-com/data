Vogel, <i>Ant. Ch. St.,</i> pp. 123, 166 (spelt <i>Sarobhaṅga</i>), <i>Ind. Cult.,</i> Vol. VII, p. 309. Kane (<i>Hist. Dharm.,</i> Vol. III, p. 1005) is certainly wrong when he thinks that it may be connected with <i>śarayantra</i> and <i>Śarayantrin</i> (a title bestowed in Mithilā upon a very learned man who faced the ordeal of answering satisfactorily all questions on any <i>śāstra</i> put to him by learned <i>Ācāryas</i> and also the questions put by common people). See <i>Ep.</i> <i>Ind.,</i> Vol. XXXV, pp. 95. ff. See <i>Sarāṅgha, Sarāhang,</i> etc."
