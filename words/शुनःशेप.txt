A son was born who was named Rohita, but the king put off the fulfilment of the vow under various pretexts. At last <lbinfo n='Ro+hita'/> Rohita purchased for one hundred cows Śunaḥśepha, the middle son of <lbinfo n='Ajīgar+ta'/> Ajīgarta, as a substitute for himself to be offered to Varuṇa. But the boy <lbinfo n='prais+ed'/> praised Viṣṇu, Indra, and other deities, and escaped death. He was then adopted by Viśvāmitra in his own family and called by the name Devarāta]."
