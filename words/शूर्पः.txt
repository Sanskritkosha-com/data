[She was attracted by the beauty of Rāma, and solicited him to marry her. But he said that as he had already got a wife she had better go to <lbinfo n='Laksh+maṇa'/> Lakshmaṇa and try him. But he too rejected her, and back she came to Rāma. This circumstance excited Sītā's laughter, and the revengeful demoness, feeling herself grossly insulted, assumed a <lbinfo n='hide+ous'/> hideous form and threatened to eat her up. But Lakṣmaṇa cut off her ears and nose, and thus doubly deformed her; see <ls>R. 12. 32-40</ls>]. --वातः wind produced by shaking a winnowing-basket. --श्रुतिः an elephant."
