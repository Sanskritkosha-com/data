Their names are given 〔9471—6〕: Nanda, Upananda, Punarvasu, Chanda, Aśvaka, Udāyin; the <lang>Pali</lang> list agrees only in part. Nanda and Upananda also belong to this group in <ls>Divy</ls>; see <ab>s.v.</ab> <b>Nandopananda</b>. In <lang>Pali</lang> they seem to be represented as followers of the Buddha, though very imperfect ones, often transgressing rules of propriety. In <lang>BHS</lang>, at least in <ls>Divy</ls>, they seem to be heretics from the Buddhist standpoint."
