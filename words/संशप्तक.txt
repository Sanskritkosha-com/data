(pl.): A general term to designate the group of five Trigarta brothers and their followers who together took the oath to kill Arjuna; their army in general, which included besides Trigartas also Mālavas and many other Janapadas, is also referred to as Saṃśaptaka; sometimes Nārāyaṇas and Gopālas also figure in the context of Saṃśaptakas. <b>A.</b> Description: Heroic (<i>vīra</i>) 3. 240. 33; 7. 17. 30; 8. 12. 4; 8. 14. 18; brave (<i>śūra</i>) 8. 14. 5; 8. 40. 94; 8. 42. 3; tigers among men (<i>naravyāghra</i>) 7. 17. 2; skilled in the use of missiles (<i>kṛtāstra</i>) 6. 20. 15; fond of battles (<i>yuddhaśaunḍa</i>) 8. 31. 14; great chariot-fighters (<i>māhāratha</i>) 1. 1. 131; 7. 26. 10, 18; famous, widely known (<i>prakhyāta</i>) 3. 240. 22; (<i>nāmalabdhānām</i> <i>viditānāṃ samantataḥ</i>) 8. 40. 94. <b>B.</b> Epic events: (1) Saṃśaptakas took away Arjuna from the main battle-field; after Abhimanyu's death, Arjuna killed all the surviving Saṃśaptakas—these two chief points of the epic events mentioned while listing the contents of the Droṇaparvan in the Parvasaṃgrahaparvan 1. 2. 160, 163; (2) Dānavas informed Duryodhana who was taken to Rāsātala by a <i>kṛtyā</i> that the Saṃśaptakas were Daityas and Rākṣasas in hundreds and thousands appointed to kill Arjuna and they would kill him; then Duryodhana felt assured that (Karṇa and) the Saṃśaptakas were meant to kill Arjuna and that they were capable of accomplishing the task; the mind of the Saṃśaptakas was under the spell of Rākṣasas and, overcome by the qualities <i>rajas</i> and <i>tamas,</i> they were eager to kill Arjuna (<i>sāṃśaptakāś ca te</i> <i>vīrā rākṣasāviṣṭacetasaḥ / rajastamobhyāṃ</i> <i>ākrāntāḥ phalgunasya vadhaiṣiṇaḥ //</i>) 3. 240. 22, 30, 33; (3) Saṃjaya told Dhṛtarāṣṭra that in the ensuing war the five Kekaya brothers would take on the two chief Trigartas of the Saṃśaptakas (<i>trigar-</i> <i>tānāṃ ca dvau mukhyau yau tau śaṃśa-</i> <i>ptakāv iti</i>) 5. 56. 18; (4) An <i>ayuta</i> of Saṃśaptaka chariot-fighters were meant to fight with Arjuna resulting either in the death or victory of Arjuna; they followed Arjuna wherever he went (<i>saṃśaptakānām</i> <i>ayutaṃ rathānāṃ mṛtyur jayo vārjunasyeti</i> <i>sṛṣṭāḥ / yenārjunas tena … prayātā vai te</i>) 6. 20. 15 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 6. 20. 15; <i>yena</i> <i>yatra tena tatra</i>); (5) Śuśarman, king of Trigartas, and his five brothers Satyaratha, Satyadharman, Satyavarman, Satyeṣuḥ and Satyakarman together with their army of Trigartas, as well as Mālavas, Tuṇḍikeras, Mācellakas, Lalitthas, Madrakas and many other Janapadas took the oath (<i>śapatha</i>) to kill Arjuna 7. 16. 11, 15-21; the mode of oath, also called <i>pratijñā,</i> in which offerings were given in fire, described 7. 16. 22-37; in the description of the war, in the context of Saṃśaptakas, besides some of those groups of people mentioned above, also occur Nārāyaṇas, Gopālas (7. 17. 31; 7. 18. 7), and Yaudheyas (7. 18. 16); (6) On the twelfth day of the war, Droṇa planned a battle between Arjuna and the Saṃśaptaka troops and when Arjuna left the main battlefield to fight with them, he arranged his army in the Suparṇavyūha against Pāṇḍavas (<i>vidhāya yogaṃ pārthena saṃśaptaka-</i> <i>gaṇaiḥ saha</i>) 7. 19. 2-4; the Saṃśaptakas arranged their chariots on even ground in the <i>vyūha</i> called Candrārdha; they were delighted to see Arjuna approaching them for a fight; they roared loudly; Arjuna was surprised to find that they were delighted when actually they should have been grieved; or, he thought, perhaps, they were delighted because they would go to excellent worlds (after death) which were otherwise difficult to be obtained by bad people 7. 17. 1-6; hearing the sound of Devadatta conch blown by Arjuna, the army of Saṃśaptakas became motionless; regaining consciousness they started fighting with Arjuna by showering <i>kaṅkapatrin</i> arrows against him 7. 17. 9-11; the battle described in which Subāhu, Sudharman and Sudhanvan also participated 7. 17. 12-22; at the death of Sudhanvan, his followers, afraid, ran towards the army of Duryodhana 7. 17. 23; Suśarman, king of Trigartas, rebuked those who fled; he reminded them of their terrific oaths (<i>śaptvā tu</i> <i>śapathān ghorān</i>); the troops of Saṃśaptakas then blew their conches and returned to fight till death (<i>mṛtyuṃ kṛtvā nivarta-</i> <i>nam //</i>) 7. 17. 27-31; seeing that the troops of Saṃśaptakas were returning Arjuna asked Kṛṣṇa to drive his chariot towards them; he was determined to kill them 7. 18. 1-3; the Vāyavyāstra released by Arjuna to ward off the arrows of the opponents also blew away a large number of Saṃśaptakas along with their chariots, horses, elephants and weapons; Arjuna killed a large number of Saṃśaptakas; their condition as well as the condition of the battle-field described 7. 18. 22-37; Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṃjaya how Arjuna dealt with the army of Saṃśaptakas (<i>saṃśaptakabalaṃ prati</i>) and how did they encounter him 7. 25. 2; Arjuna left Saṃśaptakas for a while to fight with Bhagadatta who was routing the Pāṇḍava army; fourteen thousand Saṃśaptakas followed him and challenged him; Arjuna hesitated for a while whether to fight with Saṃśaptakas or go to help Yudhiṣṭhira; ultimately he decided to kill Saṃśaptakas (first) (<i>abhavad bhuyasī buddhiḥ saṃśa-</i> <i>ptakavadhe sthirā</i>); the great Saṃśaptaka chariot-fighters (<i>saṃśaptakamahārathāḥ</i>) discharged numerous smooth arrows (<i>śata-</i> <i>sahasrāṇi śarāṇāṃ nataparvaṇāṃ</i>) on Arjuna with the result that, covered with the arrows, neither Arjuna, nor Kṛṣṇa, nor his horses, nor chariot, could be seen; when Kṛṣṇa was deluded (<i>moham anuprāptaḥ … </i> <i>janārdanaḥ</i>) Arjuna killed Saṃśaptakas with Vajrāstra 7. 26. 10, 12-14, 18-20; the condition of Saṃśaptakas described 7. 26. 21-27; having killed Saṃśaptakas Arjuna asked Kṛṣṇa to drive his chariot towards Bhagadatta 7. 26. 29; but Suśarman and his Saṃśaptaka brothers followed Arjuna challenging him for a fight (<i>yuddhārthī</i> <i>pṛṣthato 'nvayāt // … suśarmāhvayate</i> <i>'cyuta //</i>); Arjuna therefore was again in doubt-whether to kill Saṃśaptakas first or to go to the aid of his side 7. 27. 2-5; he asked Kṛṣṇa to turn back and started fighting with Suśarman; his battle with Saṃśaptaka brothers described in which Suśarman swooned 7. 27. 7-10; later, Arjuna continued to kill the surviving Saṃśaptakas and Nārāyaṇas on the southern side of the army (<i>dakṣiṇena tu senāyāḥ</i> <i>kurute kadanaṃ bali /saṃśaptakāvaśeṣasya</i> <i>nārāyaṇabalasya ca //</i>) 7. 30. 29; after killing the Saṃśaptakas, Arjuna returned to attack Droṇa and the Kaurava army 7. 31. 41-44; (7) On the thirteenth day, when Droṇa reiterated the necessity of removing Arjuna from the main battle, Saṃśaptakas renewed their challenge to Arjuna and took him away to the south of the battlefield (<i>āhvayann arjunaṃ saṃkhye dakṣiṇām</i> <i>abhito diśam</i>) 7. 32. 15; towards the end of the day, Arjuna proceeded towards his camp after killing Saṃśaptakas 7. 50. 1-3; Yudhiṣṭhira, grieved over the death of Abhimanyu, told Arjuna that after he left to fight with the Saṃśaptaka army, Droṇa made a serious attempt to capture him 7. 51. 1; (8) On the fourteenth day, at the instance of Duryodhana, the army of Kauravas, along with Saṃśaptakas, returned to fight with Sātyaki with great determination (<i>te punaḥ saṃnyavartanta</i> <i>kṛtvā saṃśaptakān mithaḥ</i>) 7. 97. 12; when Duḥśāsana was wounded by Sātyaki, Duryodhana asked Trigartas to fight with Sātyaki; Saṃśaptakas again made a determined effort to attack Sātyaki; Sātyaki killed their five hundred chief warriors, showering arrows on them, at the head of the army (<i>agrānīke vyapothayat</i>) 7. 99. 3-7; their condition described 7. 99. 8-11; ultimately they retreated in the direction of Droṇa 7. 99. 12; (9) When Dhṛtarāṣṭra was told that on the sixteenth day, angry Arjuna attacked the Saṃśaptaka troops (<i>saṃśaptakagaṇān</i> 8. 9. 8) he wished to know the details of the fight between Saṃśaptakas and Arjuna; Arjuna entered the large ocean-like troops of Saṃśaptakas (<i>saṃśaptakagaṇaṃ … arṇavasaṃnibham</i>) and agitated it (<i>vyakṣobhayat</i>); the fight in which Arjuna cut off the hands and heads of his opponents with sharp arrows and killed elephants and horses along with their riders as well as chariot-fighters was hairraising (<i>lomaharṣaṇam</i>) 8. 12. 1, 3-13; at that point Aśvatthāman challenged Arjuna; hence he asked Kṛṣṇa whether he should continue killing Saṃśaptakas or accept the challenge of Aśvatthāman: Kṛṣṇa drove him to Aśvatthāman 8. 12. 21-22; after fighting with Aśvatthāman, Arjuna returned to Saṃśaptaka horse-riders, chariotfighters, elephant-riders and foot-soldiers (<i>tataḥ saṃśaptakān bhūyaḥ sāśvasūtaratha-</i> <i>dvipān / dhvajapattigaṇān</i>) 8. 12. 36; battle described in which Arjuna killed all kinds of his opponents (<i>saṃśaptakamahārṇavam /</i> <i>vyaśoṣayata duḥśoṣam … </i>) and returned to fight with Aśvatthāman 8. 12. 37-43, 47; after fighting for a while with him, Arjuna came back to Saṃśaptakas; he cut off the hands, heads, weapons etc. of the opponents who did not turn back (<i>aparāṅmukhānām</i>) 8. 12. 54-58; after Arjuna's one more encounter with Aśvatthāman in which the latter was removed from the battle by his horses, Arjuna continued his battle with Saṃśaptakas 8. 12. 70-71; when there was loud noise to the north of the battle-field (8. 13. 1), Kṛṣṇa advised Arjuna to go there and first fight with Māgadha Daṇḍadhāra; he could later kill the Saṃśaptakas 8. 13. 4; accordingly, Arjuna first killed Daṇḍadhāra and his elephant and came back to Saṃśaptakas 8. 13. 25; in the battle that followed, Arjuna killed many Saṃśaptakas, while Kṛṣṇa drove his chariot in various roundabout ways (<i>vakrānuva-</i> <i>kragamanāt</i>) 8. 14. 1; the battle described 8. 14. 2-21; at that moment Kṛṣṇa advised Arjuna not to while away his time with Saṃśaptakas; he should kill them without loss of time and hasten to kill Karṇa (<i>kiṃ krīḍase 'nagha / saṃśaptakān prama-</i> <i>thyaitāṃs tataḥ karṇavadhe tvara</i>); Arjuna agreed and killed quickly the remaining Saṃśaptakas (<i>kṣipraṃ śiṣṭān saṃśapta-</i> <i>kāṃs tadā / ākṣipya śastreṇa balād … </i> <i>avadhīt</i>) 8. 14. 22-23; Trigartas, along with Śālvas, Saṃśaptakas, and Nārāyaṇas, led by the king of Trigartas and his brothers, attacked Arjuna 8. 19. 2-4; the battle, in which Saṃśaptakas were killed by hundreds and thousands (<i>śataśo 'tha sahasraśaḥ</i> 8. 19. 19) and at one stage they surrounded Arjuna and showered him with weapons, described 8. 19. 5-34; in the end almost the entire Saṃśaptaka army turned back and did not stay to face Arjuna (<i>prāyaśo</i> <i>vimukhaṃ sarvaṃ nāvatiṣṭhata saṃyuge</i>); Arjuna thus won victory over many Saṃśaptaka troops (<i>saṃśaptakagaṇān bahūn</i>) 8. 19. 34-35; (10) On the seventeenth day, thirty-four thousand chariot-fighters of Śaṃśaptakas determined to fight to the end stood on the left side of the Bārhaspatyavyūha of Kauravas (<i>catustriṃśatsahasrāṇi</i> <i>rathānām anivartinām / saṃśaptakā … </i> <i>vāmaṃ pārśvam apālayan … bārhaspatyaḥ</i> <i> … mahāvyūhaḥ</i>) 8. 31. 14, 26; Śalya drew attention of Karṇa to Saṃśaptakas who had challenged Arjuna; in response, they were being attacked and killed by Arjuna; angered Saṃśaptakas covered him on all sides making Arjuna invisible (<i>saṃśaptakaiḥ kruddhaiḥ … channaḥ pārtho</i> <i>na dṛśyate</i>) 8. 31. 56-57; Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṃjaya to describe to him the battle between Arjuna and Saṃśaptakas; Saṃjaya told him that when the armies were arrayed (<i>atha vyūḍheṣv anīkeṣu</i>), Arjuna attacked Saṃśaptakas; wishing to kill Arjuna and determined to win victory not minding death (<i>vijaye kṛta-</i> <i>saṃkalpā mṛtyuṃ kṛtvā nivartanam</i>) they rushed towards Arjuna; their army consisted of many horses, elephants, chariotfighters and foot-soldiers; a fierce battle then took place; Arjuna cut off their hands, holding different weapons, as well as their heads; thinking Arjuna's chariot was drowned in the large army, Saṃśaptakas delightfully raised a roar (<i>tasmin sainye</i> <i>mahāvarte … /nimagnaṃ taṃ rathaṃ matvā</i> <i>neduḥ saṃśaptakā mudā / </i>) 8. 32. 1-13; at the site where Arjuna was killing Saṃśaptakas a loud sound of Gāṇḍīva was heard; very much angered Saṃśaptakas, coveting victory (<i>jayagṛddhāḥ pramanyavaḥ</i>) showered arrows on Arjuna; Arjuna braved their attack and reached Suśarman; when Arjuna started showering arrows on Suśarman, Saṃśaptakas responded the same way; hearing the roar of the monkey on Arjuna's chariot, the army of Saṃśaptakas was much terrified and became motionless; regaining consciousness, the warriors showered arrows on Arjuna and covered his chariot; they held firmly the horses, the wheels and the shaft of Arjuna's chariot and roared loudly (<i>te hayān rathacakre ca ratheṣāś</i> <i>cāpi bhārata / nigṛhya balavat</i>); some mounted on Arjuna's chariot and held him and Kṛṣṇa; shaking his hands Kṛṣṇa felled them down; Arjuna saw Saṃśaptaka great chariot-fighters encircling him and holding his chariot and Kṛṣṇa; he felled many of them down who had mounted the chariot and other foot-soldiers who were close to him by shooting arrows which went short distances (<i>apātayat / āsannāṃś ca tato</i> <i>yodhāñ śarair āsannayodhibhiḥ</i>); he made the rest run away; Arjuna pointed out to Kṛṣṇa that he had killed thousands of Saṃśaptakas who had achieved the difficult task of checking his chariot (<i>kurvāṇān</i> <i>dāruṇaṃ karma … rathabandhaṃ imaṃ /</i> <i>ghoraṃ</i>); Arjuna and Kṛṣṇa blew Devadatta and Pāñcajanya conches respy.; hearing that sound, the Saṃśaptaka army shook and became very much afraid (<i>saṃ-</i> <i>cacāla … vitrastā cābhavad bhṛśam</i>); Arjuna then bound their feet by releasing <i>nāgāstra;</i> he killed them in that condition; when they were being killed, they gave up fighting with Arjuna and threw down their weapons; then Suśarman released them from their bonds by using <i>sauparṇāstra;</i> once free, they showered arrows and weapons on Arjuna (<i>sasṛjur bāṇasaṃ-</i> <i>ghāṃś ca śastrasaṃghāṃś ca</i>); Arjuna cut off the missiles with arrows and killed many elephants, horses and chariot-fighters by using <i>aindrāstra;</i> the troops of Saṃśaptakas and Nārāyaṇas were then very much afraid; no one was able to fight back Arjuna (<i>na</i> <i>hi kaścit pumāṃs tatra yo 'rjunaṃ pratya-</i> <i>vidhyata</i>); Arjuna then killed an <i>ayuta</i> of the opposing warriors; fourteen thousand (foot) warriors, an <i>ayuta</i> of chariotfighters, and three thousand elephantriders of Saṃśaptakas who survived (<i>yāni</i> <i>śiṣṭāni</i>) once again surrounded Arjuna determined either to return with victory or die (<i>martavayam iti niścitya jayaṃ vāpi</i> <i>nivartanam</i>); a fierce fighting then was fought between them and Arjuna (8. 37. 1-38); Arjuna destroyed many Saṃśaptakas; their Kṣatriyas, tormented by him, were killed (<i>te kṣatriyā dahyamānās … </i> <i>jagmur vināśam</i>) 8. 40. 5-61 after killing many Saṃśaptaka troops (<i>nihatya … saṃ-</i> <i>śaptakagaṇān bahūn</i>), Arjuna pointed out to Kṛṣṇa the great Saṃśaptaka chariotfighters who along with their troops ran away as they were unable to resist his arrows (<i>dhāvanti sagaṇāḥ saṃśaptakamahā-</i> <i>rathāḥ / apārayanto madbāṇān</i>) 8. 40. 7880; Duryodhana again incited Saṃśaptakas to face Arjuna; then a thousand chariotfighters, three hundred elephant-riders, fourteen thousand horse-riders and two hundred thousand archers turned towards Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna covering them with arrows; but Arjuna killed ten thousand Saṃśaptakas 8. 40. 92-99; thus Arjuna completely destroyed (<i>kṛtsnena vyadha-</i> <i>mat</i>) the Saṃśaptakas 8. 40. 130; when the armies of Kurus and Sṛñjayas met again only a few Saṃśaptakas had survived (<i>saṃśaptakeṣu … kiṃcicchiṣṭeṣu</i>); Arjuna, after defeating Aśvatthāman (8. 42. 51), asked Kṛṣṇa to take him to Saṃśaptakas since fighting with them was his main task (<i>kāryam etat paraṃ mama</i>) 8. 42. 3, 56; Arjuna killed the remaining Saṃśaptaka troops with sharp arrows with the result that they became the guests of Indra and became free from grief as they were happy (<i>śakrasyātithitām gatvā viśokā hy</i> <i>abhavan mudā</i>) 8. 43. 76-77; when Arjuna told Bhīma that he could not leave the battlefield (to go to enquire about Yudhiṣṭhira) without killing Saṃśaptakas who faced him, Bhīma assured him that he himself would fight with the Saṃśaptakas 8. 45. 63-64; Arjuna while explaining to Yudhiṣṭhira why he had not yet killed Karṇa told him that during his fight with Saṃśaptakas, Aśvatthāman had unexpectedly intervened (to distract him) 8. 47. 2; later, while boasting about his heroic deeds Arjuna mentioned that he had killed almost all Saṃśaptakas and only a few of them had survived (<i>saṃśaptakānāṃ kiṃcid</i> <i>evāvaśiṣṭam</i>) 8. 49. 96; at one stage, Duḥśāsana along with the fully equipped army of Saṃśaptakas (<i>pṛtanā samṛddhā</i>) attacked Bhīma 8. 53. 9; when Arjuna was proceeding towards Karṇa, Saṃśaptaka chariot-fighters attacked him showering arrows; Arjuna killed many of them along with their charioteers, and cut off their bows and banners with sharp arrows; they all fell down from their chariots 8. 59. 3-5; (11) On the seventeenth day, at night, when Saṃjaya reported to Dhṛtarāṣṭra the death of Karṇa (8. 1. 25), he (Dhṛtarāṣṭra), while recalling some of the major events of war, mentioned the killing of the Saṃśaptaka army by Arjuna 8. 1. 41; in reply to Dhṛtarāṣṭra's question who of the Kurus were still alive and who dead (<i>ke nu jīvanti ke mṛtāḥ</i>) 8. 4. 3, Saṃjaya mentioned Saṃśaptaka troops (<i>saṃśaptakagaṇāś ca ye</i>) among those who were killed by Arjuna 8. 4. 38; (12) On the eighteenth day, Arjuna speedily rushed towards Kṛtavarman and Saṃśaptaka troops which were posted on the left side of the Sarvatobhadravyūha of Kauravas 9. 7. 30, 19, 24 (where Saṃśaptakas are designated as Trigartas); Arjuna, having killed Saṃśaptakas in battle (<i>hatvā saṃśaptakān raṇe</i>) rushed towards, the army of Kauravas 9. 9. 59; as the day advanced (<i>madhyaṃdinagate sūrye</i>), Aśvatthāman, helped by Saṃśaptakas (<i>saṃśaptakavṛto raṇe</i>), fought with Arjuna; the battle was terrific in which a large number of warriors were killed (<i>tatra</i> <i>yuddhaṃ mahac cāsīt … yamarāṣṭravivar-</i> <i>dhanam</i>) 9. 13. 42-43; (<i>vimardas tu mahān</i> <i>āsīt</i>) 9. 13. 45; (13) On the nineteenth day, after the war was over, Saṃjaya, having returned early in the morning from the camp (<i>tataḥ pūrvāhṇasamaye śibirād</i> <i>etya saṃjayaḥ</i> 9. 1. 14), while reporting to Dhṛtarāṣṭra the war-events mentioned Saṃśaptakas among those who were killed in war 9. 1. 26; Dhṛtarāṣṭra lamenting the loss of life in war mentioned that many Saṃśaptakas were killed (<i>saṃśaptakāś ca</i> <i>bahavaḥ (nihatāḥ)</i>) 9. 2. 34; (14) Kṛṣṇa, while giving an account of war to Vasudeva, mentioned that before the fall of Abhimanyu, Saṃśaptakas had challenged Arjuna for a battle and took him away from the main scene (<i>samāhūte tu saṃ-</i> <i>grāme pārthe saṃśaptakais tadā</i>) 14. 60. 19. <b>C.</b> Arjuna is described as the killer of Saṃśaptakas <i>saṃśaptakaniṣūdana</i> 14. 73. 32, <i>saṃśaptakanihantṛ</i> 14. 76. 9.
