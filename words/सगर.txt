He subdued the <i>Haihayas</i> and the <i>Tālajaṅgḥas</i>. His wives were <i>Vaidarbhī</i> and <i>Śaibyā</i>. With them he on <i>Kailāsa</i> practised ascetic austerities in order to obtain a son, and practising yoga he succeeded in seeing <i>Śiva</i>, who said that owing to the <i>muhūrta</i> at which <i>S</i>. had addressed his prayers to him, one of the wives of <i>S</i>. would have 60,000 sons of exceeding pride, who should perish altogether, and the other wife would have one valorous son, who would perpetuate the race of <i>S</i>. Then <i>Śiva</i> disappeared and <i>S</i>. and his wives went home. <i>Vaidarbhī</i> after some time brought forth a gourd and <i>Śaibyā</i> a beautiful son. As <i>S</i>. was about to throw away the gourd, a voice from the sky told him to take out the seeds and preserve them in steaming vessels partly filled with clarified butter, as they would become 60,000 sons (III, <b>106</b>). The <i>rājarṣi S</i>. did as he was told, and provided a nurse for every receptacle. When they were born their acts were ruthless, they were able to roam about in the sky and harassed the gods, the <i>Gandharvas</i>, the <i>Rākṣasas</i>, and all beings. The gods, etc., went to Brahmán, who dismissed them saying that in a short time the sons of <i>S</i>. would be destroyed. When after some time they were protecting <i>S.'s</i> sacrificial horse who roamed over the world, the horse suddenly disappeared when it had come to the waterless sea. Having told <i>S</i>. that the horse had been stolen, they were commanded to search for it, but they did not find it. <i>S</i>. then filled with wrath forbade them to return without the horse. They then began to dig the sea with spades, etc., and killed <i>Asuras, Uragas</i> (snakes), <i>Rākṣasas</i>, and other beings by hundreds and thousands. After a long time they dug down to <i>Pātāla</i> in the north-eastern region, and seeing the horse there they ran after it without heeding <i>Kapila</i> (“whom they say is Vāsudeva,” v. 8880), who was present there. <i>Kapila</i> then burnt them to ashes. <i>Nārada</i> told it to <i>S.</i>, who sent for <i>Aṃśumat</i>, the son of his son <i>Asamañjas</i>, whom he had abandoned according to his duty and for the good of the citizens: III, <b>106</b>, 8830, 8831 (<i>Ikṣvākūṇāṃ kule jātaḥ</i>), 8841; <b>107</b>, 8859 (<i>rājā</i>), 8869 (<i>°ātmajāḥ</i>), 8871 (do.), 8876 (do.), 8882 (<i>°āntikaṃ</i>).—§ 388 (Asamañjas): III, <b>107</b>, 8887, 8888 (<i>Asamañjāḥ…S°sya</i> <i>sutaḥ</i>), 8890 (abandoned his son Asamañjas).—§ 389 (Gaṅgāvataraṇa): III, <b>107</b>, 8895, (8896), 8898, 9905, 9907, 9909, 9911, 9912 (asked by <i>S.</i>, Aṃśumat repaired to Kapila, who granted him the horse and that his grandson should bring the Gaṅgā down from heaven. <i>S</i>. made the ocean his son and was succeeded on the throne by Aṃśumat); <b>108</b>, 9939 (<i>°ātmajān</i>; Bhagīratha, the grandson of Aṃśumat, by the favour of Mahādeva brought down the Gaṅgā, that she might besprinkle the bodies of the sons of <i>S</i>.).—§ 478 (Dhundhumārop.): III, <b>204</b>, 13609 (<i>pureva Kapilaḥ…S°ātmajān</i>, sc. <i>adahat</i>, all. to § 387).—§ 552 (Goharaṇap.): IV, <b>56</b>ζ, 1769 (came from heaven to see the encounter).—§ 565 (Gālavacarita): V, <b>109</b>, 3796 (<i>vidur yaṃ Kapilaṃ devaṃ</i> <i>yenārttāḥ Sagarātmajāḥ</i>, all. to § 387).—§ 632<i>b</i> (Ṣoḍaśarāj.): XII, <b>29</b>, 1023 (<i>Aikṣvākuṃ</i>): Also <i>S</i>. of Ikṣvāku's race fell a prey to death. Sixty thousand sons walked behind him. He performed 1,000 horse sacrifices and gave precious gifts to the brahmans (description). Through anger he caused the earth to be excavated, and thus she came to have the ocean on her bosom, for this the ocean has come to be called Sāgara after the name of <i>S</i>.—§ 640 (Rājadh.): XII, <b>57</b>, 2054 (<i>Bāhoḥ putreṇa…S°ena…Asamañjāḥ…</i> <i>tyaktaḥ</i>, all. to § 388).—§ 700 (Mokṣadh.): XII, <b>289</b>, 10613 (<i>itihāsaṃ purātanaṃ Ariṣṭaneminā proktaṃ S°āyānu—</i> <i>pṛcchate</i>), (10614) (instructed by Ariṣṭanemi).—§ 734 (Ānuśāsanik.): XIII, <b>26</b>, 1838 (<i>putrān S°syeto bhaṣmākhyān</i> <i>anayad divaṃ</i>, sc. <i>Gaṅgā</i>, all. to § 389).—§ 761 (do.): XIII, <b>115</b>δ, 5668 (did not eat meat during the month of Kārttika). —§ 770 (do.): XIII, <b>151</b>, 7130 (<i>Sagarasyātmajā</i> (C. by error <i>Sā° jo</i>) <i>yena plāvitās tāritās tathā</i>, sc.
