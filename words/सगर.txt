He subdued the <i>Haihayas</i> and the <i>Tālajaṅgḥas</i>. His wives were <i>Vaidarbhī</i> and <i>Śaibyā</i>. With them he on <i>Kailāsa</i> practised ascetic austerities in order to obtain a son, and practising yoga he succeeded in seeing <i>Śiva</i>, who said that owing to the <i>muhūrta</i> at which <i>S</i>. had addressed his prayers to him, one of the wives of <i>S</i>. would have 60,000 sons of exceeding pride, who should perish altogether, and the other wife would have one valorous son, who would perpetuate the race of <i>S</i>. Then <i>Śiva</i> disappeared and <i>S</i>. and his wives went home. <i>Vaidarbhī</i> after some time brought forth a gourd and <i>Śaibyā</i> a beautiful son. As <i>S</i>. was about to throw away the gourd, a voice from the sky told him to take out the seeds and preserve them in steaming vessels partly filled with clarified butter, as they would become 60,000 sons (III, <b>106</b>).

When they were born their acts were ruthless, they were able to roam about in the sky and harassed the gods, the <i>Gandharvas</i>, the <i>Rākṣasas</i>, and all beings. The gods, etc., went to Brahmán, who dismissed them saying that in a short time the sons of <i>S</i>. would be destroyed. When after some time they were protecting <i>S.'s</i> sacrificial horse who roamed over the world, the horse suddenly disappeared when it had come to the waterless sea. Having told <i>S</i>. that the horse had been stolen, they were commanded to search for it, but they did not find it. <i>S</i>. then filled with wrath forbade them to return without the horse. They then began to dig the sea with spades, etc., and killed <i>Asuras, Uragas</i> (snakes), <i>Rākṣasas</i>, and other beings by hundreds and thousands.
