The poets are believed to have been both literary critics and composers. Literary compositions of the age were later collected and compiled into anthologies known as <i>Eṭṭuttokai,</i> <i>Pattuppāṭṭu</i> and <i>Padineṇkīḻkaṇakku</i> according to their contents and size. The <i>saṅgam</i> is stated to have flourished at Kūḍal (also called Madurai in later literature) in the first and last period and at Kavāṭapuram in the middle period. The latest limit for the first two anthologies may be placed round about 700 A.D. See M. S. Purnalingam Pillai, <i>Tamil Literature,</i> pp. 14-18; S. Vaiyapuri Pillai, <i>History of Tamil Language and</i> <i>Literature,</i> p. 38."
