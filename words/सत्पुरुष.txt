They are evidently a lay category, and are mentioned immediately after a list of Bodhisattvas. According to <ls>Professor Paul Mus (oral communication, May, 1949)</ls>, they are a kind of lay equivalent of the Bodhisattvas, who live the life of gṛhapatis; <ls>Prof. Mus</ls> finds a typical illustration of them in the figure of <b>Vimalakīrti</b> (<ab>q.v.</ab>), so well known in Chinese Buddhism. In <lang>BHS</lang>, <ab n='Vimalakīrti'>V.</ab> is not listed so far as I know except once in a list of 16 Bodhisattvas. The term satpuruṣa may include monks: <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.37.4〕 (see <ab>s.v.</ab> <b>labhā, labhyaṃ</b>)."
