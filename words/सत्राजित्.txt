[He got the <i>Syamantaka</i> jewel from the sun and always wore it round his neck.

Kṛṣṇa, however, <lbinfo n='over+took'/> overtook Jāmbavat and vanquished him in fight after a long struggle. The <lbinfo n='monkey+chief'/> monkeychief thereupon presented it along with his daughter to Kṛṣṇa; see जांबवत्. Kṛṣṇa then gave the jewel back to its proper owner Satrājit, who out of gratitude presented it along with his daughter Satyabhāmā to him. <lbinfo n='After+wards'/> Afterwards when Satyabhāmā was at her father's house with the jewel, <lbinfo n='Śatadhan+van'/> Śatadhanvan, at the instigation of a Yādava named Akrūra who desired the jewel for himself, killed Satrājit and gave it to Akrūra. Śatadhanvan was <lbinfo n='after+wards'/> afterwards killed by Kṛṣṇa, but when he found that the jewel was with Akrūra, he allowed him to retain it with <lbinfo n='him+self'/> himself after having once shown it to the people.]"
