Ed. 9. 41. 1) and started giving offerings of flesh of dead animals; as a result the kingdom of Dhṛtarāṣṭra began to waste away; he was therefore advised to propitiate Baka in a bower in the water of Sarasvatī (<i>apāṃ kuñje sarasvatyās taṃ</i> <i>prasādaya pārthiva</i>) and request Baka to forgive him for his fault 9. 40. 10-21; (also see No. 27 below); (10) For the sacrifice of Yayāti, son of Nahuṣa, Sarasvatī brought in her currents clarified butter and milk (<i>ghṛtaṃ payaś ca susrāva</i>); in that sacrifice, Sarasvatī fulfilled the wishes of Brāhmaṇas by producing many juices (?) in accordance with their wishes (<i>yatra yatra</i> <i>hi yo vipro yān yān kāmān abhīpsati /</i> <i>tatra tatra saricchreṣṭhā sasarja subahūn</i> <i>rasān</i>) 9. 40. 30, 33; (11) Viśvāmitra practised severe austerities on an excellent <i>tīrtha</i> (not named) of Sarasvatī and became a Brāhmaṇa 9. 39. 23, 28-29; the <i>āśrama</i> of Vasiṣṭha was at Sthāṇutīrtha on the eastern bank of Sarasvatī and that of Viśvāmitra on the western bank; at the <i>tīrtha</i> Vasiṣṭhāpavāha, Viśvāmitra was able to displace Vasiṣṭha with the help of severe austerities (<i>vasiṣṭhaṃ cālayām āsa tapa-</i> <i>sogreṇa</i>) 9. 41. 4, 8; Viśvāmitra wanted Sarasvatī to bring Vasiṣṭha to him swiftly so that he could kill him (Vasiṣṭha); Viśvāmitra therefore thought of Sarasvatī; she appeared before him, trembling with fear, and asked him what she might do for him; Viśvāmitra told the river what he wanted her to do; hearing that Sarasvatī was pained; she just stood there all the while shaking with fear; Viśvāmitra asked her again to bring Vasiṣṭha quickly to him; she was worried what to do as she was afraid of the curses of both the sages; she went to Vasiṣṭha and informed him what Viśvāmitra's desire was; Vasiṣṭha saw her pale and lean and told her to carry him to Viśvāmitra and save herself from the latter's curse; hearing that Sarasvatī reflected on what she might do which would turn out beneficial to Vasiṣṭha as he had been merciful to her; when she saw on the other bank Viśvāmitra engaged in giving offerings she thought that to be the right moment to act swiftly (<i>saras-</i> <i>vaty abhyacintayat / idam antaram ity eva</i> 9. 41. 26-27); she washed away a part of her bank on the side of Vasiṣṭha so that he was carried on her current to the <i>āśrama</i> of Viśvāmitra; while he was being thus carried Vasiṣṭha praised Sarasvatī (Sarasvatī's praise 9. 41. 29-31); Sarasvatī informed Viśvāmitra that she had brought Vasiṣṭha; Viśvāmitra began to look for a weapon to kill Vasiṣṭha; being afraid of the sin of killing a Brāhmaṇa Sarasvatī carried Vasiṣṭha back to the eastern bank (<i>brahmahatyābhayān nadī / apovāha</i> <i>vasiṣṭhaṃ tu prācīṃ diśam atandritā</i> 9. 41. 34); she thus did what both the sages asked her to do, but Viśvāmitra was deceived; enraged, he cursed the river to flow with blood; as a result Sarasvatī flew with water mixed with blood for a year; the sages, gods, Gandharvas and Apsarases were excessively pained to see Sarasvatī in that condition; this is how the <i>tīrtha</i> Vasiṣṭhāpavāha came into existance 9. 41. 11-39; when Sarasvatī carried blood with water in her current, Rākṣasas came there and were happy to drink blood from the river water; once, some sages, while visiting the <i>tīrthas,</i> came to Vasiṣṭhāpavāha they saw the Rākṣasas drinking blood from the river; they decided to do something to save the river; they invited Sarasvatī and found out from her the cause of the disturbed condition of the <i>tīrtha</i> (<i>kāraṇaṃ brūhi kalyāṇi kimarthaṃ te</i> <i>hrado hy ayam / evam ākulatāṃ yātaḥ</i> 9. 42. 9); on hearing the cause, they decided to free the river from the curse; by their mere word Sarasvatī returned to her normal condition and her water was as placid as before (<i>teṣāṃ tu vacanād eva prakṛtisthā</i> <i>sarasvatī / prasannasalilā jajñe yathā pūr-</i> <i>vam tathaiva hi</i> 9. 42. 13); the excellent river shone as before; since the river water was normal again the Rākṣasas were afflicted by hunger and they requested the sages to relieve them from that condition; the sages praised the river and urged her to relieve the Rākṣasas from their condition; knowing what the sages wanted Sarasvatī brought to her current the river Aruṇā (<i>aruṇām ānayām āsa svāṃ</i> <i>tanum</i>); bathing in that river the Rākṣasas abandoned their bodies and went to heaven 9. 42. 1-25; (12) While Dadhīca was giving offerings to gods on the bank of Sarasvatī (<i>tasya tarpayato devān sarasvatyām</i> 9. 50. 8), the Apsaras Alambusā, sent by Indra to disturb the austerities of Dadhīca, approached him; seeing her divine form the seed of Dadhīca spilled into water of Sarasvatī; the river held it in her womb as she desired to have a son and also because the seed might not be wasted (<i>kukṣau cāpy adadhat … </i> <i>tad retaḥ … putrahetor mahānadī</i> 9. 50. 10; <i>na vināśam idaṃ gacchet tvatteja iti niśca-</i> <i>yāt</i> 9. 50. 14); when Sarasvatī delivered the child at proper time she took him to Dadhīca; seeing Dadhīca seated in the assembly of sages she handed over the child to him saying it was his son whom she bore out of her devotion to the sage (<i>brahmarṣe tava putro</i> <i>'yaṃ tvadbhaktyā dhārito mayā</i> 9. 50. 12); Dadhīca accepted the child and was very much delighted; he then gave the following boon to Sarasvatī: “all gods, manes, Gandharvas and Apsarases will be satisfied when they receive offerings of your water (<i>tṛptiṃ yā-</i> <i>syanti subhage tarpyamāṇās tavāmbhasā</i> 9. 50. 17); the sage then praised the great river (9. 50. 19-20); he declared that this her son will be known as Sārasvata after the mother's name (<i>tavaiva nāmnā prathitaḥ</i> <i>putras te lokabhāvanaḥ</i> 9. 50. 21); he also declared that by his grace Sarasvatī would be the holiest of all holy rivers (<i>puṇyābhyaś</i> <i>ca saridbhyas tvaṃ sadā puṇyatamā śubhe /</i> <i>bhaviṣyasi mahābhāge matprasādāt saras-</i> <i>vati</i> 9. 50. 23); when praised by the sage and having received a boon from him Sarasvatī went away taking her son with her 9. 50. 5-24; (13) Once there was drought lasting for twelve years; when Sārasvata, like other people, wanted to leave the place and go elsewhere in search of food, Sarasvatī told him not to leave the place; she assured him to provide food to him in the form of excellent fish; Sārasvata therefore lived there; he ate the food offered by the river and preserved the Vedas 9. 50. 36-38; (14) Bharata, son of Duḥṣyanta and Śakuntalā, bound twenty horses for sacrifice on the bank of Sarasvatī (<i>sarasvatīṃ viṃśatiṃ ca</i>) 12. 29. 41; (15) Gārgya satisfied Śiva by offering a mental sacrifice on the bank of Sarasvatī (<i>sarsvatyās</i> <i>taṭe tuṣṭo manoyajñena pāṇḍava</i>); Śiva then gave him wonderful knowledge of time (<i>kālajñānaṃ mamādbhutam</i>), a thousand sons, equal to Gārgya, versed in the exposition of Brahman (<i>tulyaṃ mama sahasraṃ tu</i> <i>sutānāṃ brahmavādinām</i>), and very long life to him and to his sons 13. 18. 25-26; (16) Nahuṣa invited Agastya, who was then on the bank of Sarasvatī, to come to him and draw his carriage (<i>vāhanāyājuhāva</i> <i>saḥ / drutaṃ sarasvatīkūlāt</i>) 13. 103. 12; (17) Utathya, angered at the abduction of his wife by Varuṇa, began to drink up water everywhere, compelled the ocean to recede and asked Sarasvatī: “Be invisible in a desert land; when deserted by you let the land be unholy” (<i>adṛśyā gaccha bhīru</i> <i>tvaṃ sarasvati maruṃ prati /apuṇya eṣa</i> <i>bhavatu deśas tyaktas tvayā śubhe</i>) 13. 139. 25-26; (18) Sarasvatī was one of the rivers seen by Mārkaṇḍeya in the belly of the Bāla (3. 186. 83 = Nārāyaṇa 3. 187. 3) 3. 186. 96; (19) Janamejaya asked Vaiśaṃpāyana the origin of the Saptasārasvata tīrtha; Vaiśaṃpāyana then began the narration of a past event in which Sarasvatī, when invited for a sacrifice at different places, appeared there under different names 9. 37. 1, 3-4; (i) When Pitāmaha (Brahmadeva) thought of Sarasvatī she first appeared as Suprabhā at Puṣkara to make the sacrifice of Pitāmaha on this earth highly fruitful (<i>mahāphalaḥ</i>); Sarasvatī thus showed her respect for Pitāmaha (<i>pitāmahaṃ mānayantīm</i>) 9. 37. 11-14; (ii) When Sarasvatī was thought of by the sages performing a <i>satra</i> at Naimiṣa forest she appeared there as Kāñcanākṣī to help the sages (<i>sahāyārthaṃ mahātmanām</i>); she was honoured by the sages (<i>pūjitā</i>) 9. 37. 15-18; (iii) When she appeared for the sacrifice of Gaya among the people of Gayā (<i>gayeṣu</i>), sages called her Viśālā 9. 37. 20; (iv) In the sacrifice of Auddālaki in the northern Kosalas when she was thought of by Auddālaka the river appeared there for him (<i>ājagāma</i> <i>saricchreṭhā taṃ deśam ṛṣikāraṇāt</i>) under the name Manohradā (Mānasahradā in 9. 37. 4) since she was carried there by the sages through the agency of their mind (<i>sā hi</i> <i>tair manasā hṛtā</i>); the river was honoured there by the sages (<i>pūjyamānā munigaṇaiḥ</i>) 9. 37. 21-23; (v) In the Ṛṣabhadvīpa the river appeared with the name Suveṇu 9. 37. 24; (vi) In the sacrifice of Kuru at Kurukṣetra. when invoked by Vasiṣṭha, the river Sarasvatī appeared with the name Oghavatī 9. 37. 24-25; (vii) In the sacrifice of Dakṣa at Gaṅgādvāra the river appeared as Vimalodā 9. 37. 26 (Vimalodakā 9. 37. 4); when Brahman offered a sacrifice again he called the river back on the Himavant mountain; the <i>tīrtha</i> where all the seven forms of the river got united became famous as Saptasārasvata 9. 37. 2628; (20) When the chariot of Śiva was got ready for his fight with Asuras fighting from the Tripuras the Mahānadīs became its hind parts (<i>jaṅghās tasya mahānadīḥ</i>) 8. 24. 69 (Sarasvatī could be one of these ‘big rivers’; but cf. the next); (21) Sarasvatī was the <i>parirathya</i> (?) of Śiva's chariot 8. 24. 75 (however, according to Nī. on Bom. Ed. 8. 34. 34, <i>sarasvatī</i> here means speech: <i>parirathyā pracāramārgaḥ /</i> <i>sarasvatī vāgdevīkalpitaḥ śabdamātraśarīra</i> <i>ity arthaḥ</i>); (22) When Hari resorted to another body with the head of a horse for the rescue of the Vedas, Gaṅgā and Sarasvatī became his two eyebrows (<i>gaṅgā sarasvatī</i> <i>puṇyā bhruvāv āstāṃ mahānadī</i>) 12. 335. 46; (23) The gods, led by Brahman, took with them Skanda and went to Himavant and the river Sarasvatī for his consecration as the general of their army 9. 43. 50-52; they consecrated Skanda at Sthāṇutīrtha on Sarasvatī 9. 41. 6-7; gods consecrated Skanda as their general with the holy waters of Sarasvatī having heavenly waters (<i>sarasvatībhiḥ</i> <i>puṇyābhir divyatoyābhir eva tu / abhyaṣiñcan</i> <i>kumāraṃ vai</i>) 9. 44. 18-19; (24) Dakṣa told gods that the emaciated Soma (moon) would grow again after bathing in the excellent <i>tīrtha</i> on Sarasvatī (<i>sarasvatyā vare</i> <i>tīrthe unmajjan śaśalakṣaṇaḥ / punar</i> <i>vardhiṣyate devāḥ</i>); Soma then proceeded to the great <i>tīrtha</i> Prabāsa on Sarasvatī 9. 34. 67, 69; (25) Sthāṇu (Śiva) offered a sacrifice and honoured Sarasvatī and then established Sthāṇutīrtha on the river 9. 41. 8; (26) When Indra was pursued by the head of Namuci, Pitāmaha (Brahman) asked Indra to offer a sacrifice and to bathe in Aruṇā; Indra then offered a sacrifice in the Kuñja of Sarasvatī and bathed in Aruṇā (<i>sarasvatyāḥ</i> <i>kuñje … iṣṭvā … aruṇāyām upāspṛśat</i>) 9. 42. 34-35; (27) At the <i>tīrtha</i> (not named) situated near the <i>āśrama</i> of Baka Dālbhya on the river Sarasvatī (9. 39. 32; 9. 40. 1) Bṛhaspati gave offerings of flesh for the prosperity of gods and the decline of Asuras (<i>asurāṇām abhāvāya bhāvāya ca</i> <i>divaukasām</i>) 9. 40. 26-27; (28) Sarasvatī was one of the rivers whom Umā wanted to consult on <i>strīdharma</i> before expounding it to Śiva as these rivers were well-versed in it; Umā thereby wanted to honour the rivers; the rivers appointed Gaṅgā to speak on their behalf to Umā 13. 134. 13, 19-22, 25. <b>G.</b> Importance: (1) One of the rivers who wait upon Varuṇa in his Sabhā (<i>upā-</i> <i>sate mahātmānam</i>) 2. 9. 19, 22; (2) Mentioned twice in the Daivata-Ṛṣi-Vaṃśa recited by Bhīṣma 13. 151. 14, 22, (2). <b>H.</b> Simile: Draupadī having five Pāṇḍavas as her husbands was very happy with them and they with Draupadī as is Sarasvatī with the Nāgas (<i>babhūva paramaprītā nāgair iva</i> <i>sarasvatī</i>) 1. 205. 3 (Nī. on 1. 213. 3: <i>nāgair gajaiḥ;</i> he, however, adds: <i>sarasvatī</i> <i>bahusaroyuktā vanasthalī / sā hi gajair</i> <i>yuktānyaiś chettum aśakyā / tayā ca gajā</i> <i>balinaḥ / evaṃ te mitho vṛddhihetavaḥ</i>).

            "content": "<b>Sarasvatī</b>¦<sup>1</sup> is the name of a river frequently mentioned in the Rigveda and later. In many passages<sup>2</sup> of the later texts it is certain the river meant is the modern Sarasvatī, which loses itself in the sands of Patiala (see <b>Vinaśana</b>). Even Roth<sup>3</sup> admits that this river is intended in some passages of the Rigveda. With the <b>Dṛṣadvatī</b><sup>4</sup> it formed the western boundary of Brahmāvarta (see <b>Madhyadeśa</b>). It is the holy stream of early Vedic India. The Sūtras<sup>5</sup> mention sacrifices held on its banks as of great importance and sanctity. <div n='P'/>In many other passages of the Rigveda,<sup>6</sup> and even later,<sup>7</sup> Roth held that another river, the <b>Sindhu</b> (Indus), was really meant: only thus could it be explained why the Sarasvatī is called the ‘foremost of rivers’ (<i>nadītamā</i>),<sup>8</sup> is said to go to the ocean,<sup>9</sup> and is referred to as a large river, on the banks of which many kings,<sup>10</sup> and, indeed, the five tribes, were located.<sup>11</sup> This view is accepted by Zimmer<sup>12</sup> and others.<sup>13</sup> <div n='P'/>On the other hand, Lassen<sup>14</sup> and Max Müller<sup>15</sup> maintain the identity of the Vedic Sarasvatī with the later Sarasvatī.<sup>16</sup> The latter is of opinion that in Vedic times the Sarasvatī was as large a stream as the Sutlej, and that it actually reached the sea either after union with the Indus or not, being the ‘iron citadel,’ as the last boundary on the west, a frontier of the Panjab against the rest of India. There is no conclusive evidence of there having been any great change in the size or course of the Sarasvatī, though it would be impossible to deny that the river may easily have diminished in size. But there are strong reasons to accept the identification of the later and the earlier Sarasvatī throughout. The insistence on the divine character of the river is been in the very hymn<sup>17</sup> which refers to it as the support of the five tribes, and corresponds well with its later sacredness. Moreover, that hymn alludes to the <b>Pārāvatas,</b> a people shown by the later evidence of the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa<sup>18</sup> to have been in the east, a very long way from their original home, if Sarasvatī means the Indus. Again, the <b>Pūrus,</b> who were settled on the Sarasvatī,<sup>19</sup> could with great difficulty be located in the far west. Moreover, the five tribes might easily be held to be on the Sarasvatī, when they were, as they seem to have been, the western neighbours of the <b>Bharatas</b> in <b>Kurukṣetra,</b> and the Sarasvatī could easily be regarded as the boundary of the Panjab in that sense. Again, the ‘seven rivers’ in one passage<sup>20</sup> clearly designate a district: it is most probable that they are not the five rivers with the Indus and the <b>Kubhā</b> (Cabul river), but the five rivers, the Indus and the Sarasvatī. Nor is it difficult to see why the river is said to flow to the sea: either the Vedic poet had never followed the course of the river to its end, or the river did actually penetrate the desert either completely or for a long distance, and only in the Brāhmaṇa period was its disappearance in the desert found out. It is said, indeed, in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā<sup>21</sup> that the five rivers go to the Sarasvatī, but this passage is not only late (as the use of the word <b>Deśa</b> shows), but it does not say that the five rivers meant are those of the Panjab. Moreover, the passage has neither a parallel in the other Saṃhitās, nor can it possibly be regarded as an early production; if it is late it must refer to the later Sarasvatī. <div n='P'/>Hillebrandt,<sup>22</sup> on the whole, adopts this view of the Sarasvatī,<sup>23</sup> but he also sees in it, besides the designation of a mythical stream, the later Vaitaraṇī,<sup>24</sup> as well as the name of the Arghandab in Arachosia.<sup>25</sup> This opinion depends essentially on his theory that the sixth Maṇḍala of the Rigveda places the scene of its action in Iranian lands, as opposed to the seventh Maṇḍala: it is as untenable as that theory itself.<sup>26</sup> Brunnhofer<sup>27</sup> at one time accepted the Iranian identification, but later<sup>28</sup> decided for the Oxus, which is quite out of the question.

The connexion of Sarasvatī and the seven rivers is rather vague.

In vii. 36, 6, she is called the ‘seventh,’ which makes the Sarasvatī one of the rivers. If the former passages are to be treated as precise, then <i>sapta-</i> <i>svasā</i> may be considered to show that the Sarasvatī was outside the river system (which would then be Indus, Kubhā, and the five rivers of the Panjab; see <b>Sapta Sindhavaḥ</b>); but the expression may be loosely meant for one of seven sisters.</F> <F>21) xxxiv. 11.</F> <F>22) <i>Vedische Mythologie,</i> 1, 99 <i>et seq.;</i> 3, 372-378.</F> <F>23) He sees this sense in the Rigveda everywhere, except in the passages indicated in notes 24 and 25.</F> <F>24) vii. 95, 6; x. 17, 7; Av. vii. 68, 2; xiv. 2, 20; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xxxv. 10, 11.</F> <F>25) Rv. vi. 49, 7; 61; possibly Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxxiv. 11.</F> <F>26) See <b>Divodāsa.</b></F> <F>27) Bezzenberger's <i>Beiträge,</i> 10, 261, n. 2.</F> <F>28) <i>Iran und Turan,</i> 127. <div n='P'/><i>Cf.</i> Muir, <i>Sanskrit Texts,</i> 5, 337 <i>et seq.,</i> Macdonell, <i>Sanskrit Literature,</i> 141, 142; <i>Vedic Mythology,</i> pp. 86-88; von Schroeder, <i>Indiens Literatur und Cultur,</i> 84, 164.</F>"
