As the <i>hotṛ</i> with <i>mantras</i> began to pour clarified butter into the fire, <i>Indra</i> appeared in his <i>vimāna</i> with the gods, <i>Vidyādharas</i> and <i>Apsarases</i>, and <i>Takṣaka</i> hid himself in the upper garment of <i>Indra.

Shaking off <i>Takṣaka, Indra</i> quickly returned to his own abode. <i>Takṣaka</i> was now falling from heaven, and <i>Janamejaya</i> promised to grant to <i>Āstīka</i> what he might desire. <i>Āstīka</i> said: “Let no more snakes fall into the fire,” and refused to ask for any other boon (I, <b>56</b>). —§ 63: Enumeration of the principal snakes of <i>Vāsuki's</i> race that fell into the fire; (§ 64) of <i>Takṣaka's</i> race; (§ 65) of <i>Airāvata's</i> race; (§ 66) of <i>Kauravya's</i> race; (§ 67) of <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra's</i> race (I, <b>57</b>).—§ 68 <i>Janamejaya</i> let the sacrifice come to an end; he bestowed wealth unto <i>Lohitākṣa</i>, etc."
