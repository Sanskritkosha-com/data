            "content": "<b>Setubandhana(ṃ)</b>¦ (“the building of the bridge”). § 535 (cf. Rāmopākhyānap.): The monkey chiefs (α) began to flock together to <i>Rāma</i> and <i>Sugrīva</i> on <i>Mālyavat</i>. On a lucky day the army set out. <i>Hanūmat</i> was in the van, <i>Lakṣmaṇa</i> in the rear, the army was protected by <i>Nala</i>, etc. (β). Arriving at the shore of the milky ocean (<i>kṣīrodaṃ…</i> <i>sāgaraṃ</i>, v. 16289), <i>Rāma</i> thought of means of crossing it. He and <i>Lakṣmaṇa</i> lay down on the seashore, the Ocean appeared to him in a vision and said: “I also have sprung from the race of Ikṣvāku; the monkey <i>Nala</i> is a son of <i>Tvaṣṭr</i>, whatever he will throw into my waters I will support.” <i>Nala</i> then built a bridge, which to this day is known as <i>Nalasetu</i>. At this time <i>Vibhīṣaṇa</i> with four of his counsellors came to <i>Rāma. Sugrīva</i> suspected him to be a spy, but <i>Rāma</i> installed him in the sovereignty of all the <i>Rākṣasas</i> and made him his own counsellor and the friend of <i>Lakṣmaṇa</i>. It was under the guidance of <i>Vibhīṣaṇa</i> that the army crossed the bridge in a month. <i>Rāma</i> then caused the gardens of <i>Laṅkā</i> to be devastated by his monkeys. <i>Rāvaṇa's</i> counsellors <i>Śuka</i> and <i>Sāraṇa</i> came as spies and were seized by <i>Vibhīṣaṇa</i>, but dismissed by <i>Rāma. Rāma</i> then sent <i>Aṅgada</i> as his envoy to <i>Rāvaṇa</i> (III, <b>283</b>)."
