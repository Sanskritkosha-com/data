K·πõ·π£·πáa thought that Ugrasena was worthy of having it; knowing this SatrƒÅjit gave it to his brother Prasena. He placed it in a room and hedged it with divinity. K·πõ·π£·πáa asked for it and was refused. It was taken to the forest by Prasena whom a lion killed. JƒÅmbavƒÅ killed the lion and got the jewel. K·πõ·π£·πáa fought with him and recovering the jewel, returned it to SatrƒÅjita in a public assembly. SatrƒÅjita offered his daughter in marriage to K·πõ·π£·πáa and made a gift of the jewel. K·πõ·π£·πáa returned it to SatrƒÅjita. ≈öatadhanvan killed SatrƒÅjita and took it, and placed it with Akr≈´ra for safe custody. This led to some misunderstanding between K·πõ·π£·πáa and RƒÅma, and at K·πõ·π£·πáa's request, Akr≈´ra made it public that it was in his possession. <div n='P'/>BhƒÅ.
