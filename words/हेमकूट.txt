            "content": "<b>Hemakūṭa</b>.¦ § 390<i>b</i> (Tīrthayātrāp.): On the mountain <i>H</i>. the utterance of words (so PCR., who follows the various reading cited by Nīl., <i>“vācā yatra bhavan,”</i> instead of <i>“vātā-</i> <i>baddhā bhavan”</i>) caused the gathering of clouds and stones by thousands. There the recitation of the sacred scriptures was heard, but nobody was seen; in the evening and the morning there was seen fire, and biting flies would interrupt the austerities. Lomaśa explained that formerly on this <i>Ṛṣabhakūṭa</i> (i.e. Hemakūṭa) dwelt a great and resentful ṛṣi, who was many hundred years old, and was named Ṛshabha. When practising austerities he had been spoken to by others, and in wrath he ordered the mountain to throw stones on him who should utter any word there, and forbade the wind to make any noise. Therefore, as soon as a man utters any word here he is forbidden by a roaring cloud. Formerly, when the gods came to the <i>Nandā</i>, many men came to see them, but the gods with Indra at their head did not like to be seen, and therefore they rendered the spot inaccessible by raising obstructions in the form of mountains, and from that day onwards men could not see that hill, far less ascend it. Lomaśa further said: “Here all the gods performed the best sacrifices, and the marks thereof may be seen to this day, the grass resembling <i>kuśa</i> grass, and many trees resembling <i>yūpas</i>; the gods and ṛṣis dwell there to this day, and it is their fire which is seen in the evening and the morning. By bathing here one's sins are destroyed”: III, <b>110</b>, 9969 (<i>parvataṃ</i>, near the River Nandā and Aparanandā, visited by Yudhiṣṭhira, etc., on his tīrthayātrā).—§ 459 (Mārkaṇḍeyas.): III, <b>188</b>, 12917 (<i>parvataṃ</i>, seen by Mārkaṇḍeya in the stomach of Nārāyaṇa).—§ 574 (Jambūkh.): VI, <b>6</b>β, 198 (the second of the six <i>varṣaparvatāḥ</i> of Jambudvīpa), 202 (beyond <i>H</i>. lies Harivarṣa), 236 (identified with Kailāsa, q.v.), (θ), 246 (inhabited by Guhyakas)."
